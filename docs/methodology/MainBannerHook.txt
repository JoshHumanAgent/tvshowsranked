Don’t know what to watch next?

We built this ranking engine to solve that problem properly.

Instead of relying on one overall score, we break every show into seven categories — the actual ingredients that make something great. Characters. World-building. Narrative power. Cinematography. Resolution.

We score hundreds of series and rank the top 100 based on real performance across these categories.

And if your taste is different? Adjust the weights instantly.

If you think spectacle matters less, turn it down.
If storytelling is everything, turn it up.
If you don’t agree with a rating, slide it yourself.

You’re not stuck with our default.
You’re driving the engine.
