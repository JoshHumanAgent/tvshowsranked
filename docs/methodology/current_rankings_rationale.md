# Current Rankings Rationale

## Recent Score Updates (2026-02-16)

### Breaking Bad: 8.55 → 8.80 (+0.25)

**Rationale:** Second-pass slider adjustment revealed that Breaking Bad's cinematography and conceptual density were underscored. The series' use of color symbolism, time-lapse sequences, and visual storytelling (particularly in seasons 4-5) justifies a bump in the cinematography score. Additionally, the show's exploration of moral decay, capitalism, and Heisenberg's transformation warrants higher conceptual density recognition.

**Dimension Changes:**
- **Cinematography (cine):** 9 → 10 — The visual language (desert landscapes, color-coded timelines, meticulous framing) is among television's finest.
- **Conceptual Density (conc):** 8 → 9 — Deeper appreciation for the thematic layering around ego, empire-building, and moral justification.

**Impact:** Breaking Bad solidifies its #2 position, creating clearer separation from The Wire/Better Call Saul cluster.

### True Detective S1: 8.28 → 8.08 (-0.20)

**Rationale:** Re-evaluation of the season's spectacle elements revealed over-scoring. While the cinematography (Cary Fukunaga's long takes) and character work remain elite, the actual "visual spectacle"—action sequences, set pieces, and memorable imagery—is more restrained than initially credited. The season's power comes from atmosphere and performance, not visual spectacle.

**Dimension Changes:**
- **Visual Spectacle (spect):** 8 → 6 — Limited action sequences; the Carcosa finale is atmospheric rather than spectacular. The season prioritizes dread over spectacle.

**Impact:** True Detective S1 drops to #10 but remains in the elite tier, swapping places with Succession.
