# TV Shows Ranked: Scoring Learnings & Patterns

*Documented after first 10 scores — 2026-02-15*

---

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES (Strict Standards)

### The 9+ Rule
- **9s are RARE** — Only for elite tier shows
- **9.5s** — Reserved for absolute best-in-category (The Wire world-building, Breaking Bad characters)
- **10s** — Nearly impossible. Only Game of Thrones S1-4, The Wire, True Detective S1 cinematography

**Reality Check:** Most shows should score 7-8. If I'm handing out 9s freely, I'm being too generous.

---

## 📊 CATEGORY PATTERNS

### Characters & Acting (20%)
**How to score:**
- **9.5-10** — 6+ extraordinary characters (Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Succession)
- **9.0** — 4-5 deep characters, lead is transcendent (The Bear, The Americans)
- **8.5** — 4-5 strong characters, lead excellent (Shōgun, Slow Horses, Ripley)
- **8.0** — Good ensemble, some standouts (Mad Men, Lost, Dark)
- **7.5** — Functional, some memorable (Squid Game)
- **7.0** — Lead carries thin supporting cast (Mare of Easttown, Pachinko)

**Common error:** Giving 9s to shows with ~4 good characters. That's 8.5 territory.

---

### World Building (15%)
**The encyclopedia test:** Could I write a wiki about this world?

- **10** — Only The Wire, Game of Thrones (Baltimore institutions, Westeros history)
- **9.5** — Nearly encyclopedic (Dark's time travel logic, Expanse's solar system politics)
- **9.0** — Babylon Berlin, The Expanse
- **8.5** — Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire, Rome, Andor, Shōgun
- **8.0** — Strong period work (Mad Men, The Crown, Narcos)
- **7.5** — Specific but limited (Slow Horses, The Day of the Jackal)
- **6.5-7.0** — Intimate dramas where world is backdrop (The Bear, Six Feet Under)
- **5.0** — Generic/minimal

---

### Cinematography (10%)
**The frame test:** Could I identify this show from a single frame?

- **10** — True Detective S1, Hannibal, Utopia UK (unmistakable visual identity)
- **9.5** — The Knick, Mindhunter, Adolescence (director-driven masterpieces)
- **9.0** — Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, Babylon Berlin (distinctive, intentional)
- **8.5** — Shōgun, The Bear, Dark, Ripley (strong craft, recognizable)
- **8.0** — Squid Game, The Queen's Gambit (stylish but not iconic)
- **7.5** — Professional, effective, not distinctive

**Note:** The Sopranos, The Wire, The Shield score 6-7 intentionally—unglamorous realism is the point.

---

### Visual Spectacle (10%)
**Not cinematography — what is shown, not how it's shot**

- **10** — Foundation (galactic scale throughout)
- **9.5** — Game of Thrones S1-4, House of the Dragon (dragons, battles, castles)
- **9.0** — Babylon Berlin, Chernobyl, Band of Brothers, Shōgun, Squid Game
- **8.5** — Rome, Boardwalk Empire, The Expanse, Andor
- **8.0** — The Queen's Gambit, Ripley, Mare of Easttown
- **7.5** — Modest period work, some ambition
- **6.5** — The Bear, The Americans (intentionally small scale)
- **5.0** — Offices, suburbs, homes

---

### Conceptual Density (15%)
**How many college courses could be taught using this show?

- **10** — The Wire (institutions, race, class, education, media, labor, politics), Angels in America
- **9.0** — Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, Dark (multiple rich ideas from different angles)
- **8.5** — Shōgun, Andor
- **8.0** — Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mad Men, The Americans (focused but deep, 3-4 major themes)
- **7.5** — Slow Horses, Squid Game, Pachinko (clear themes, explored well)
- **7.0** — Succession (one central idea repeated), Mare of Easttown (familiar territory)
- **6.5** — The Day of the Jackal (standard thriller themes)

**Key:** Ideas must be dramatized, not stated. Theme ≠ density.

---

### Narrative Drive (15%)
**Do I need to watch the next episode, or can I wait?**

- **10** — Breaking Bad, Chernobyl, Game of Thrones S1-4 (relentless momentum)
- **9.0-9.5** — Better Call Saul, The Shield, 24, Beef, Severance, Squid Game (propulsive, hard to stop)
- **8.5** — Shōgun, Slow Horses, The Bear, The Queen's Gambit (compelling, some deliberate pacing)
- **8.0** — The Wire, The Sopranos, Dark (rewarding but tests patience)
- **7.5** — Ripley, Pachinko (deliberately slow, literary pacing)
- **6.0** — Mad Men, Six Feet Under (glacial pace, seasons drag)
- **5.0** — Lost (spinning wheels, frustrating)

---

### Narrative Resolution (15%)
**Did the show earn its ending? Did it close its loops?**

**THIS SEPARATES GOOD FROM GREAT**

- **10** — Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Americans, Six Feet Under, Chernobyl (perfect or near-perfect closure)
- **9.5** — Dark (every thread connects, bootstrap paradox resolved)
- **9.0** — The Queen's Gambit (complete self-contained arc)
- **8.5** — The Sopranos, The Wire, Fargo
- **8.0** — Mad Men, Ripley, Mare of Easttown (solid, most threads tied)
- **7.5** — Shōgun (strong season finale, opens next threads)
- **7.0** — The Bear, Slow Horses, Squid Game (closes season loops, larger story open)
- **6.5-7.0** — Pachinko, The Day of the Jackal (ongoing, incomplete but not frustrating)
- **5.0** — Lost, The Handmaid's Tale (mystery boxes, abandoned threads, frustrating)

**Important:** Ambiguity is fine (The Sopranos = 9.0). Unresolved mess is not (Lost = 5.0).

## 🔢 MULTIPLIER GUIDE

| Type | Multiplier | When to use |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Miniseries | 0.96 | Self-contained, intended to be that length (Chernobyl, Mare of Easttown) |
| Ongoing (10-20 eps) | 0.95 | 1-2 seasons, S3+ announced (Shōgun, The Bear, Slow Horses) |
| Ongoing (21-30) | 0.97 | 2-3 seasons complete |
| Complete (31-40) | 1.00 | Full story told, all seasons finished |
| Complete (41-50) | 1.02 | Longer complete runs |
| Complete (51-60) | 1.03 | Fargo, The Handmaid's Tale (if ended) |
| Complete (61-75) | 1.04 | Breaking Bad, The Wire length |
| Complete (76-100) | 1.05 | The Sopranos, Mad Men, The Americans |
| Complete (100+) | 1.06 | Lost, 24, Homicide (rarity) |

**Key distinction:** A show cancelled after one season is NOT a miniseries.

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Too generous with 9s** — 9s are elite tier. Most shows 7-8.
2. **Undervaluing Resolution** — This is what makes shows great, not good.
3. **Overvaluing spectacle** — Shōgun isn't GoT scale. Intimate shows score lower on Spect but that's okay.
4. **Forgetting the encyclopedia test** — World Building 9+ = encyclopedic (GoT, The Wire). Most shows 7-8.
5. **Confusing theme with density** — One clear theme ≠ high Conceptual Density.
6. **Rushing** — Compare to anchors. Take time. Quality over speed.

---

## ✅ SANITY CHECK QUESTIONS

Before finalizing a score:

1. **Would I rank this above [anchor at similar score]?**
   - If scoring 7.8: "Is this as good as Mad Men?"
   - If scoring 8.2: "Is this as good as The Expanse?"

2. **Am I being too generous?**
   - Too many 9s = recalibrate
   - Compare to existing shows at that score

3. **Does the Resolution score make sense?**
   - Complete story → 8-9+
   - Ongoing/good season finale → 7-7.5
   - Ongoing/concerning direction → 6
   - Abandoned threads → 5

4. **Would this feel right in the ranked list?**
   - Imagine inserting it. Does it fit?

---

## 📝 SCORING WORKFLOW

1. **Watch/research** the show
2. **Score each category** with specific reasoning
3. **Calculate base + final**
4. **Compare to anchors** — does it feel right?
5. **Adjust** if needed
6. **Final sanity check** — would I insert this at this position?

**Take time.** Not about speed. About accuracy.

## 🎬 INSIGHTS FROM FIRST 10

**What broke into Elite (8.0+):**
- **Dark** — Perfect complete ending elevated everything

**What missed Elite:**
- **Shōgun/The Bear** (7.7x) — Ongoing + smaller scope
- **Ripley** (7.94) — Deliberate pace limits Drive

**The Resolution Factor:**
- Complete stories scored higher than ongoing equivalents
- Dark (complete): 9.5 Resolution → 8.20 final
- Shōgun (ongoing): 7.5 Resolution → 7.74 final

**What kept shows in Good tier:**
- **Squid Game:** Characters thinner than elite requires
- **Pachinko:** Slow pace + incomplete story
- **Mare of Easttown:** Winslet elevates familiar material
