            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                True stories of immigrants in America. A Ugandan woman fleeing her family. An Indian boy winning a spelling bee. A Syrian man running a call center. A Chinese grandmother discovering squash. Each episode is a different story, written by the people who lived them. No famous actors (usually), no prestige-drama cynicism, just small stories about people trying to build lives in a new country. Optimistic without being naive, human-scale in the best way.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode features different performers, often non-professionals or relative unknowns. The acting varies but is consistently sincere. The real people's voices—heard in recordings at each episode's end—remind us these are true stories. The casting prioritizes authenticity over famous faces. Effective, moving, appropriate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>America as experienced by newcomers: the call centers, the convenience stores, the cheap apartments, the community colleges. Each episode creates a specific world—the squash courts of a Florida retirement community, the Indian-American spelling-bee circuit, the refugee support networks. America rendered in its particularities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple production values: clean, bright, competent. The style serves the stories without imposing itself. Different directors bring different approaches, but the anthology format prevents visual consistency. Appropriate to material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. These are small stories: a woman passing her citizenship test, a boy learning English, a man trying video games for the first time. The spectacle is emotional—the achievement of ordinary goals against extraordinary obstacles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Immigration as experience, not politics. The show avoids polemic; it dramatizes. Each story illustrates a different aspect of the immigrant experience: documentation, assimilation, generational conflict, finding community. The themes are present but gentle. Optimistic without being blind.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Half-hour episodes, each a complete story. The drive is narrative compression: fitting a life into 30 minutes. Each episode ends with the real person's voice, reminding us the story is true. Bingeable, but better spaced—the stories are similar in structure and tone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Anthology format means each episode resolves. Some stories have happier endings than others; all end with hope or achievement. The show's premise allows infinite continuation. Whether it will continue expanding the immigrant catalog remains to be seen.</p>
