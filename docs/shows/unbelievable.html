            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A teenager reports being raped at knifepoint. The police don't believe her. They charge her with false reporting. Years later, two female detectives in another state connect similar cases and realize a serial rapist has been operating for years. Based on true events, Unbelievable shows what happens when victims aren't believed, and the dedication required to make things right. It's the criminal justice system's failure and redemption, told by women who understand viscerally what male detectives missed.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Kaitlyn Dever as Marie is devastating—a girl whom the system fails repeatedly, whose trauma compounds because she's not believed. Merritt Wever and Toni Collette as the detectives are perfect: methodical, persistent, building cases through patience and empathy. The rapist (played by an unrecognizable Christopher Abbott) is revealed slowly, disturbingly. Every performance serves the true story.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Two worlds: one where a young woman is disbelieved, dismissed, prosecuted for telling the truth; another where female detectives create space for victims to speak. The contrast between Washington state and Colorado shows how different approaches yield different outcomes. The police departments, the foster care system, the interview rooms—all rendered with procedural accuracy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Functional and effective. The show doesn't stylize the assaults—what matters is the aftermath, the interviews, the investigation. The camera observes rather than exploits. The framing of Marie's interrogation versus the detectives' interviews with victims shows the difference visually: one is hostile, the other supportive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. The power is in the story, the performances, the injustice and the rectification. This is television as journalism, as advocacy, as testimony. The "spectacle" is watching competent policework finally happen after watching incompetence destroy a life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores systemic bias: why police disbelieve rape victims, trauma's effect on memory, the impossibility of "perfect victimhood." The procedural details are accurate and educational—how rape kits work, how trauma responses manifest, how serial predators operate. This is true crime that teaches rather than sensationalizes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight episodes of escalating momentum. The first episode establishes Marie's ordeal; subsequent episodes follow the detectives as they close in. Each victim's account adds to the pattern; each failure increases the stakes. The show knows exactly when to reveal information, when to withhold. Propulsive without feeling rushed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries with perfect resolution. The rapist is caught. Marie's name is cleared. The detectives provide closure. But the show doesn't pretend the damage is undone—it shows what justice looks like when it finally arrives, and how inadequate it feels. The ending is cathartic and honest.</p>
