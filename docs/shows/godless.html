<h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>

<p>Godless premiered on Netflix on November 22, 2017, created by Scott Frank (The Queen's Gambit). The seven-episode Western miniseries is set in the 1880s in La Belle, New Mexico—a town where most of the men died in a catastrophic mining accident, leaving a community run almost entirely by women. When ruthless outlaw Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his gang terrorize the region, the women of La Belle must unite to defend their town, aided by a mysterious stranger Roy Goode (Jack O'Connell) who arrives seeking shelter.</p>

<p>The series is a stunning visual achievement, shot on location in New Mexico with cinematographer Steven Meizler capturing the vast, harsh beauty of the American West. The New Mexico landscapes—canyons, mesas, endless sky—provide breathtaking backdrop to the intimate human drama. Frank's direction and Meizler's photography create a Western that feels both epic in scope and deeply personal, reminiscent of classic American Westerns while offering fresh perspective through its focus on female characters.</p>

<p>Michelle Dockery delivers a commanding performance as Alice Fletcher, a widow running a ranch on the outskirts of La Belle with her son and Native American mother-in-law. Dockery sheds her Downton Abbey elegance for a harder, more weathered character—a woman who has survived loss and built a life through sheer determination. Jack O'Connell as Roy Goode brings wounded stoicism to the role of the outlaw with a conscience, his character's backstory gradually revealed through flashbacks.</p>

<p>Merritt Wever shines as Mary Agnes McNue, the town's defacto leader who wears pants, smokes cigars, and maintains a relationship with the local schoolteacher (Tantoo Cardinal). Wever's performance captures Mary's fierce independence and hidden vulnerability. Jeff Daniels is terrifying as Frank Griffin, a charismatic preacher-turned-outlaw who justifies his violence through twisted religious conviction. Daniels makes Frank dangerously seductive—you understand why his gang follows him, even as you fear his brutality.</p>

<p>The supporting cast creates a rich community: Scoot McNairy as Sheriff Bill McNue, struggling with his inadequacy; Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Whitey Winn, a young deputy finding his courage; Kim Coates as Ed Logan, a rival sheriff; and the women of La Belle—Tess Frazer as Callie Dunne, the schoolteacher; Audrey Moore as Sarah Doyle; and many others who create a believable frontier community.</p>

<p>The series' exploration of gender roles in the Old West feels organic rather than didactic—the women's competence and strength emerges naturally from circumstances. When the men are gone, the women step up, running businesses, enforcing law, building lives. The series suggests that frontier mythology has ignored women's contributions, that the West was tamed not just by gunslingers but by mothers, widows, and survivors.</p>

<p>Cinematographer Steven Meizler, who would later work with Frank on The Queen's Gambit, creates stunning visuals that honor Western tradition while feeling fresh. The wide shots of New Mexico landscapes recall John Ford, while the intimate close-ups capture weathered faces and determined eyes. The color palette shifts between golden-hour warmth and harsh midday sun, creating visual variety that serves the story's emotional beats.</p>

<p>The action sequences are brutal and realistic—gunfights are messy, mistakes are made, the violence has weight. The climactic battle at La Belle is both spectacular and grounded, showing both tactical competence and raw courage. The series doesn't shy away from the ugliness of Western violence while celebrating the heroism of those who stand against it.</p>

<p>Critical reception was positive, with particular praise for the performances, cinematography, and the series' fresh take on Western conventions. It holds 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics noting the strong female characters and visual beauty. While some found the pacing deliberate, most praised Frank's patient storytelling and the ensemble's performances.</p>

<p>Godless stands as a worthy addition to the Western canon—a series that honors the genre's traditions while expanding its perspective, that delivers both visual spectacle and emotional depth, that proves the Western still has stories to tell. Scott Frank would go on to create The Queen's Gambit, but Godless established his ability to create period pieces with contemporary relevance, to combine genre entertainment with genuine artistry.</p>

        <p><strong>La Belle, New Mexico:</strong> The series creates a vivid portrait of an 1880s mining town, devastated by a disaster that killed most of the male population. The town's current reality—women running businesses, enforcing law, building lives—feels authentic rather than contrived from its tragic premise. The saloon, the sheriff's office, the homes, the surrounding ranchland all feel lived-in and real.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Western Frontier:</strong> The series depicts the broader Western environment—the lawlessness, the isolation, the harsh landscape, the limited technology of the era. The world of outlaws, lawmen, ranchers, and pioneers is rendered with attention to historical detail and Western genre tradition.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why 8:</strong> Strong world-building with authentic frontier detail. The limitation is the limited scope—seven episodes can't fully explore a world in the depth of longer series.</p>

        <p><strong>Steven Meizler's Visual Poetry:</strong> Cinematographer Steven Meizler creates stunning visuals that honor Western tradition while feeling fresh.

        <p><strong>The Palette:</strong> The color palette shifts between golden-hour warmth and harsh midday sun, creating visual variety that serves the story's emotional beats. The nighttime scenes use firelight and moonlight effectively, creating atmospheric shadow and glow.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Scope:</strong> The wide shots emphasize the characters' smallness against the vast landscape, while intimate close-ups capture weathered faces and determined eyes. The cinematography tells story without dialogue.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why 9:</strong> Exceptional cinematography that rivals feature film quality. Among television's most visually beautiful Westerns.</p>

        <p><strong>The Action:</strong> The gunfights are messy, realistic, and brutal. The climactic battle at La Belle is both spectacular and grounded, showing tactical competence and raw courage. The action serves story rather than dominating it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why 8:</strong> Strong spectacle through landscape and action. The limitation is intimate scale—this is a character drama with Western elements, not an action epic.</p>

        <p><strong>Gender and the Frontier:</strong> The series' central theme—frontier mythology has ignored women's contributions. When the men are gone, the women step up and prove capable. The theme emerges organically from story rather than being imposed upon it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Religious Fanaticism:</strong> Frank Griffin's violence is justified through twisted Christian theology, exploring how faith can be weaponized for evil. His charismatic leadership seduces men into following him down dark paths.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Redemption and Damnation:</strong> Roy Goode seeks redemption for his outlaw past; Frank Griffin embraces damnation. The series explores whether people can change, whether violence can be escaped, whether past crimes can be outrun.</p>

        <p><strong>The Structure:</strong> Seven episodes build toward the inevitable confrontation between Frank's gang and La Belle. The pacing is deliberate, character-focused rather than plot-driven. Flashbacks to Roy's past with Frank create parallel narrative threads.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Build:</strong> The series takes its time establishing characters and world before the final confrontation. This patient approach serves character development but requires viewer investment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why 7:</strong> Solid narrative construction with satisfying build. The limitation is deliberate pacing that some may find slow, and the familiar Western structure (stranger rides into town, confrontation builds).</p>

        <p><strong>The Finale:</strong> The climactic battle at La Belle provides satisfying resolution—Frank Griffin meets his fate, the town is defended, characters face their destinies. The resolution honors Western tradition while providing emotional payoff for character arcs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Aftermath:</strong> The final scenes show the survivors moving forward, changed by their experience but resilient. The ending acknowledges loss while affirming life, honor while recognizing the cost of violence.</p>

    <div class="final-score-value">7.37</div>

    <div style="color:#888; margin-top:1rem; font-size:0.9rem">
        The final score of 7.37 reflects Godless's strong achievement across all seven dimensions. Its combination of stunning New Mexico cinematography, strong ensemble performances (particularly Dockery, Wever, and Daniels), and fresh perspective on Western conventions—centering women's competence in a traditionally masculine genre—secures its place as a worthy addition to the Western canon. Scott Frank proves that the Western still has stories to tell, and that those stories can combine genre entertainment with genuine artistry.
