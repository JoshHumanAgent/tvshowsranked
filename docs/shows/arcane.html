<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Piltover is the city of progress. Zaun is the undercity beneath it. Two sisters are divided by the cities' war. League of Legends adapted by Riot Games and Fortiche: steampunk fantasy, family tragedy, the cost of progress. Animation as prestige drama.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Vi and Jinx: sisters divided by tragedy. Voiced by Hailee Steinfeld and Ella Purnell. The characters develop across tragedy and trauma. The voice acting matches the animation's intensity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>Piltover and Zaun: the city above, the city below, hextech, shimmer. The world is complete—steampunk fantasy with specific rules. Every detail matters.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3><p>Fortiche animation: painted style, steampunk design, action sequences that rival live-action. This is feature-quality animation. The aesthetic is unique.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (10/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is constant: hextech, shimmer, action sequences, the cities. Animation allows anything—Arcane delivers everything. Visually stunning.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Class warfare, family vs. ideology, the cost of progress, addiction, trauma. The show explores adult themes through animation. Not for children.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>The sisters separated, the cities at war, hextech as weapon. The structure is tragedy—watching the divide widen. The drive is relentless.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
<p>Season 1 complete; season 2 concludes. The story of Vi and Jinx is told. The ending provides resolution while leaving room for continuation. Masterful animation.</p></div></section>
