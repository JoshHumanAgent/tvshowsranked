            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A Cairo night manager witnesses an arms deal. Years later, he's recruited to infiltrate the dealer's inner circle. Tom Hiddleston is the operative; Hugh Laurie is the weapons merchant; Olivia Colman is the intelligence officer running the operation. Le Carré adapted for prestige television—beautiful locations, expensive suits, moral ambiguity, and the cold calculation of people who trade death for profit. Everyone has an angle; trust is the most dangerous weapon.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine is all suppressed intensity—a man transformed by purpose. Hugh Laurie as Richard Onslow Roper is terrifying: charm and ruthlessness in perfect balance, a monster who loves his family. Olivia Colman as Angela Burr is moral clarity in a world without it. Elizabeth Debicki as Jed Marshall is caught between survival and conscience. The cast is uniformly superb.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The world of international arms dealing: Mediterranean villas, Cairo hotels, London townhouses, the Cayman Islands. The show renders the ecosystem—shell companies, bribes, intelligence agencies, corrupt officials—with verisimilitude. This is how the world actually works, or close enough. The glamour is a mask for the horror.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Location shooting in Morocco, Mallorca, London, Cornwall. The show looks expensive because it is expensive. Night scenes in Cairo, sun-drenched Mediterranean exteriors, shadowy London interiors—the visual language serves the genre. This is spy fiction as glamour, and the glamour is persuasive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is environmental and emotional: luxury locations, tense standoffs, the occasional explosion. The violence, when it comes, is shocking precisely because the world is so polished. The spectacle is in contrast: beautiful people doing ugly things in beautiful places.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Le Carré's world: intelligence work as moral compromise, the impossibility of clean hands, weapons dealers as respectable businessmen. The show explores complicity—who enables the trade, who benefits, who looks away. The themes are sophisticated but delivered through thriller mechanics rather than explicit discourse.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season is perfectly paced: six episodes of escalating tension, each ending with a complication or revelation. The infiltration narrative creates inherent suspense: how deep can Pine go before he's exposed? The second season, aired years later, has struggled to recapture momentum. First season is a complete, satisfying story.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 resolves magnificently: Roper is delivered to authorities, but the cost is high. The ending is appropriate, earned, open enough for continuation but satisfying as conclusion. Season 2 exists but doesn't match the first. The show may have peaked early—but peak it did.</p>
