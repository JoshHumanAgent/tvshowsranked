            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Ko Mun-yeong is a children's book author with antisocial personality disorder—beautiful, cruel, determined to claim what she wants. Moon Gang-tae is a caretaker at psychiatric facilities, raising his autistic older brother, suppressing his own needs. Their collision is romantic and psychological: two damaged people who might heal or destroy each other. K-drama that treats mental illness seriously while delivering romance, fairy-tale aesthetic, and the slow work of becoming whole.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Seo Yea-ji as Ko Mun-yeong is magnetic: the cold exterior, the vulnerability beneath, the refusal to be pitied. Kim Soo-hyun as Gang-tae carries trauma visibly—the exhaustion, the suppressed rage, the tenderness. Oh Jung-se as the autistic brother is remarkable: specific, respectful, heartbreaking. The ensemble of patients at the psychiatric facility creates a community of the wounded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two worlds: the fairy-tale aesthetic of Mun-yeong's books and life (gothic mansions, elaborate gowns) and the reality of Gang-tae's existence (psychiatric facilities, group homes, limited resources). The show integrates them: mental illness as curse to be broken, care facilities as homes for the discarded. Specifically Korean context made universal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Fairy-tale visual language: storybook illustrations, fantasy sequences, the contrast between Mun-yeong's world and Gang-tae's. The show uses color and composition deliberately—Mun-yeong's wardrobe alone tells a story. K-drama production at its most artistic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Spectacle of style: Mun-yeong's elaborate outfits, the mansion, the fantasy sequences that interrupt the narrative. The show is beautiful, but the beauty serves character rather than overwhelming it. Spectacle of aesthetic, not action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Mental illness as neither curse nor superpower—it's just illness, requiring treatment and support. The show explores autism, antisocial personality, PTSD, schizophrenia, and the families affected by each. The romance doesn't cure; it offers companionship for the journey. Sophisticated for K-drama, sophisticated period.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Sixteen episodes with clear arcs: childhood trauma revealed, present confrontation, future healing. The pacing is classic K-drama—complication after complication, resolution earned through suffering. Each episode advances both romance and psychological exploration. Binge-worthy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Sixteen episodes, complete story. The childhood trauma is revealed, the villain confronted, the brothers find peace, Mun-yeong and Gang-tae choose each other. The ending respects the characters' healing—nothing is magically fixed, they just have each other. K-drama excellence.</p>
