            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Sherlock Holmes in contemporary London. Benedict Cumberbatch is the consulting detective with social deficits and brilliant deductions. Martin Freeman is Dr. John Watson, just back from Afghanistan. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss modernize Conan Doyle: texts instead of telegrams, nicotine patches instead of pipes, but the relationship is unchanged. Four series, 13 episodes, some of television's most influential mystery.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Benedict Cumberbatch creates the definitive modern Sherlock: brilliant, difficult, unexpectedly loyal. Martin Freeman's Watson is the audience surrogate and the heart. Andrew Scott's Moriarty is terrifying. Amanda Abbington, Louise Brealey, Una Stubbs—the supporting cast is perfect. The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman defines the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Contemporary London: Baker Street, Scotland Yard, the underground, the blogs. The world is Holmes updated—technology doesn't replace deduction, it enables it. The modernization is clever and consistent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC production at its finest: on-screen text messages, visual representations of deductions, London photographed beautifully. The style influenced television for a decade. The visual language represents Sherlock's mind.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is intellectual: deductions visualized, mysteries solved, confrontations staged. The production is high-budget; the spectacle is in the ideas and execution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Deduction, genius vs. sociopathy, the value of friendship, whether deduction is knowledge or performance. The show explores Holmes as both brilliant and difficult. The relationship is the heart.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Feature-length episodes: each is 90 minutes of mystery, deduction, and relationship. The drive is the case and the dynamic between Sherlock and Watson. The episodes are events—there are only 13, but each counts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Four series with diminishing returns. Series 1-2 are exceptional; series 3 is divisive; series 4 disappointed many. The finale attempted resolution but failed to match the early heights. The show's legacy is its first two series.</p>
