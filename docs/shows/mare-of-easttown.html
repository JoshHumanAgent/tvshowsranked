<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Mare Sheehan is a detective in a small Pennsylvania town investigating a murder while her life falls apart. Her son died. Her ex-husband is remarrying. Her mother is in her house. Kate Winslet is Mare: exhausted, competent, barely holding on. Small-town crime as family tragedy.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Kate Winslet as Mare: disappearing into the role—accent, exhaustion, the weight of everything. Julianne Nicholson as her best friend. Jean Smart as her mother. The ensemble creates the Pennsylvania town with specificity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Delaware County, Pennsylvania: the bars, the houses, the Wawa references, the community struggling after industry left. The world is specific—this is working-class Pennsylvania rendered with detail.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>HBO production: the Pennsylvania winter, the small-town claustrophobia, everyone knows everyone's business. The style serves the exhaustion—this is a town that's tired.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is a murder investigation in a small town: interviews, family dinners, lives examined. The "spectacle" is watching Winslet hold everything together.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Grief, community, whether we can move on, what we owe to the dead, generational trauma in dying towns. The show explores these through the investigation and Mare's family.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Who killed the girl? Each episode reveals secrets, narrows suspects, deepens the family drama. The structure is mystery—everyone has something to hide.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The murder solves; the grief doesn't. The ending is earned—Mare finds a way forward. Perfect limited series.</p></div></section>
