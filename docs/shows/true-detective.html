<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Each season is a different crime, different detectives. Season 1 (McConaughey and Harrelson) is the peak: Louisiana ritual murders across decades. Season 4 (Night Country) returns to form: Alaska darkness, frozen bodies. Nic Pizzolatto created anthology crime: Southern gothic as philosophy.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Season 1: Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as detectives across time. Season 4: Jodie Foster and Kali Reis in Alaska. The anthology format allows different actors each season—Season 1's performances are legendary.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Season 1: Louisiana's bayous, the occult, the corruption. Season 4: Alaska's darkness, the research station, the cold. Each season builds a complete world—the atmosphere is character.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3><p>Each season has its visual language. Season 1's six-minute take is legendary. Season 4's darkness is beautiful. HBO prestige TV at its most cinematic.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is atmosphere: Louisiana's decay, Alaska's isolation. The "spectacle" is psychological—the horror in the ordinary.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Time, memory, whether we can escape the past, cosmic horror in rural America, what evil looks like. Season 1 is philosophical crime. Season 4 is existential horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Each season is a case: the murders, the investigation, the secrets. The structure is anthology—each season complete. The drive is the mystery.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Anthology. Season 1 is legendary; seasons 2-3 vary; season 4 returned to form. Each season resolves. The format has no endpoint.</p></div></section>
