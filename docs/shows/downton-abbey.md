## What It Feels Like to Watch

Downton Abbey is a sumptuous period drama that follows the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants in early 20th century England. It's a world of privilege and tradition, about to be swept away by history.

You watch Downton Abbey and get lost in another era. The costumes are gorgeous, the estates are magnificent, and the social rituals are fascinating. But beneath the surface, change is coming. World War I will transform everything.

The series works on multiple levels. It's a family drama, with the Crawleys' relationships driving much of the narrative. It's a historical document, showing how the Great War and the 1920s changed British society. And it's a workplace story, told from the servants' perspective.

The ensemble is deep and talented. Whether you love or hate the various characters, they're memorable. The show balances tragedy and romance with skilled hands.
