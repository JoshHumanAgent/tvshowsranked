            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Assane Diop's father was framed by a wealthy family and died in prison. Assane grows up to become a gentleman thief, inspired by the Arsène Lupin stories his father gave him. Omar Sy is Assane—charming, brilliant, driven by revenge. Modern Paris, heists and cons, a father's death avenged through style. Netflix's biggest French-language hit, a caper with heart.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Omar Sy is the show: his charm, his physical presence, his ability to transform. The supporting cast (Ludivine Sagnier, Clotilde Hesme, Soufiane Guerrab) provides the targets and obstacles. The performances are light and efficient—this is entertainment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Paris: the Louvre, the wealthy apartments, the suburbs, the criminal underworld. The Lupin mythology is woven through—each episode references the original stories. The world is Paris as stage for Assane's cons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production: Paris looks beautiful, the heists are staged with clarity, the chase scenes are dynamic. The style is caper-competent—nothing groundbreaking, everything functional. The visual language serves the twists.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The heists are the spectacle: the Louvre theft, the prison escape, the train robbery. The cons are clever and staged with panache. This is heist television—spectacle is the product, and it delivers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Revenge, class, the immigrant experience in France, whether justice requires crime. The themes are present—Assane is the son of a Senegalese immigrant, fighting a white establishment—but the show prioritizes entertainment over depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each part (Netflix splits seasons) builds toward a heist or escape. The drive is relentless—cliffhangers, reveals, reversals. This is binge television designed for momentum. The Lupin stories provide structure; the revenge provides stakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Each set of episodes resolves one phase while opening another. The revenge is not complete; Assane's story continues. Netflix has committed to more; the endpoint is unclear.</p>
