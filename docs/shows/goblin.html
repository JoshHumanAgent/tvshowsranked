            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A 939-year-old goblin searching for his bride—the only one who can remove the sword embedded in his chest and finally let him die. He finds her: a 19-year-old girl with a tragic past and a destiny intertwined with his. There's also a grim reaper with amnesia, a ghost who can't pass on, and a curse that spans centuries. Korean drama at its most expansive: romantic, tragic, funny, visually sumptuous, emotionally devastating.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Gong Yoo as Kim Shin, the goblin, conveys centuries of loneliness in a single glance. Kim Go-eun as Ji Eun-tak, his bride, is luminous—funny, brave, heartbreakingly young. Lee Dong-wook as the grim reaper and Yoo In-na as the chicken shop owner create a second romance that rivals the first. The chemistry across all relationships is exceptional. K-drama acting at its finest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show creates a complete supernatural ecosystem: goblins, reapers, ghosts, gods, and the humans who interact with them. Rules are established and followed—what happens to souls, how curses work, why the goblin's sword must be removed by his bride. The mythology is Korean but accessible, blending Buddhist afterlife concepts with original fantasy elements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Visually stunning. Korea's countryside, Quebec's autumn colors, Seoul's cityscape—the show films on location and looks like cinema. The goblin's powers are rendered with CGI that serves the story rather than overwhelming it. Every frame is composed with care. This is prestige television production value applied to a genre often dismissed as lightweight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is constant: sword summoning, door opening to any destination, ghosts appearing and disappearing. The production design—ancient Korean palaces, modern architecture, the goblin's traditional-modern home—creates visual richness. The action set pieces are rare but effective. This is fantasy television with feature film resources.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores fate, memory, love that transcends lifetimes, the cost of immortality. The god who cursed the goblin asks: did you ever regret living? The question haunts the entire narrative. Time is circular—past informs present, future echoes back. The conceptual framework rewards attention without requiring scholarship.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Sixteen episodes that feel like a complete novel. The pacing is unusual: episodes run 60-90 minutes, allowing scenes to breathe. The narrative engine is the curse—will Eun-tak pull the sword?—but multiple storylines create layered tension. The show knows when to accelerate and when to linger. Compulsive viewing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete story with a devastating, beautiful ending. The final episodes deliver on every promise: the curse is resolved, the romances reach their conclusions, the cost is paid. The ending is emotionally overwhelming—in the best way. This is how to conclude a series: with finality, with consequence, with love.</p>
