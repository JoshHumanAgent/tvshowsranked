            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Seattle rain. A red sweater in a field. Detectives standing over evidence, their breath fogging in the cold. Each episode covers one day in a murder investigation, but the case keeps opening wider—family secrets, school politics, political corruption. The original Danish series set the template; this American adaptation captures the same gray-sky dread. The red herring is a feature, not a bug.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Mireille Enos as Sarah Linden is among television's great detectives—socially awkward, obsessively focused, carrying damage she never discusses. Joel Kinnaman as Holder is her opposite: street-smart, mouthy, hiding depth beneath attitude. Their partnership is the show's heart. The supporting cast—Brent Sexton and Michelle Forbes as the grieving parents—deliver devastating portraits of loss.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Seattle as pressure cooker: the constant rain, the ferry commutes, the wealth disparity between downtown and the suburbs. The show captures Pacific Northwest atmosphere in forensic detail. The political world—city council races, mayoral ambitions—overlaps with the crime in ways that feel organic. Multiple worlds collide: working-class Seattle, political Seattle, teenage Seattle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show defined a visual language: desaturated colors, shallow focus, rain on every surface. The photography creates oppressive atmosphere—you can almost feel the damp. The crime scenes are photographed with clinical detachment, emphasizing evidence over sensation. Visually distinctive, narratively appropriate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>This isn't spectacle television. The spectacle is emotional: a parent learning their child is dead, a detective making a mistake that costs a suspect their life. The show earns its impact through character, not production value. Seattle provides natural beauty, but it's used for mood rather than awe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>One day per episode creates unique temporal structure—the investigation unfolds in something like real time. The exploration of grief—how it functions differently for fathers and mothers, how communities process child murder—is sophisticated. But the core mystery is conventional: who killed Rosie Larsen? The answer, when it comes, is satisfying but not revolutionary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show creates compulsion. Each episode ends with a revelation, a new suspect, a complication. The "one day at a time" structure creates mounting urgency—the killer is getting away while we follow leads. The pacing is deliberate but never slack. You need to know what happens next; the show ensures you never have enough to figure it out yourself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1's resolution was controversial—AMC aired it believing there'd be no season 2, then renewed, leaving the "solution" incomplete. The actual resolution, when it finally came, disappointed some viewers. Season 3's serial killer case is stronger; season 4 (Netflix) concludes Linden and Holder's story well. The show's ending is good but arrived through production chaos.</p>
