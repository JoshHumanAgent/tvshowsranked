            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Matt Albie and Danny Tripp are hired to save a failing sketch comedy show. They're brilliant writers; they're also damaged. Amanda Peet is the network executive who believes in them. Aaron Sorkin takes his West Wing formula behind the scenes at Saturday Night Live—walk-and-talk dialogue, workplace romance, crisis-of-the-week television. The show that launched the same year as 30 Rock, was expected to dominate, and was cancelled after one season.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Matthew Perry as Matt is Sorkin's voice: the brilliant writer with anxiety and drug problems. Bradley Whitford as Danny is the producer who loves the wrong woman. Amanda Peet as Jordan brings authority and warmth. The ensemble (Steven Weber, Sarah Paulson, D.L. Hughley) is Sorkin-perfect. Perry's performance is underrated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Behind the scenes at Saturday Night Live: the writers' room, the stage, the control room, the network offices. The sketch-show infrastructure is rendered with Sorkin's usual accuracy. The world is complete—you understand how the show works.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Sorkin walk-and-talk: steadicam following characters through halls, dialogue delivered at speed. The style is familiar from West Wing, adapted to entertainment. The backstage world looks lived-in and professional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people making television: meetings, rehearsals, drafts. The sketches themselves are rarely shown; the focus is the process, not the product. Workplace drama without action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Art vs. commerce, network censorship, faith and doubt, love and addiction. Sorkin's themes are present: can good television survive? Can damaged people produce great work? The show is earnest in ways that dated it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episode-by-episode: the show must go on, a sketch is problematic, an actor has a crisis. The serialized arcs involve Matt and Harriet's relationship, Danny and Jordan's relationship, the network's survival. The pacing is Sorkin-fast; the drive is constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>One season, cancelled. The finale provides closure for the relationships, but the show was cancelled before it could develop. The cancellation wasn't about quality—30 Rock won the sketch-comedy-show-behind-the-scenes competition. A victim of timing.</p>
