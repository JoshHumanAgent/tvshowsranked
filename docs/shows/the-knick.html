            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1900 New York. The Knickerbocker Hospital. Dr. John Thackery is a brilliant surgeon addicted to cocaine and heroin. He clashes with Dr. Algernon Edwards, a Black surgeon hired against the staff's wishes. Steven Soderbergh directed every episode. The birth of modern medicine, rendered in blood and addiction.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Clive Owen as Thackery: the addicted genius, charismatic and self-destructive. Andre Holland as Edwards: the Black surgeon fighting every prejudice. The ensemble (Eve Hewson, Juliet Rylance, Jeremy Bobb) creates the hospital. Soderbergh's direction extracts performances of intensity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>1900 New York: the hospital, the tenements, the wealthy, the immigrants. The world is specific—this is the birth of surgery, when medicine became modern. Every detail is researched.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Steven Soderbergh as cinematographer: the operating rooms, the streets, the lighting. The style is period with modern energy—electronic score, handheld camera. The visual language is distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is surgery: visceral, bloody, primitive by modern standards. The operations are staged with unflinching realism. This is medicine as horror and wonder.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Medical innovation, addiction, race in America, class at the turn of the century, what we sacrifice for progress, the cost of genius. The show explores these through Thackery and Edwards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Thackery's addiction, Edwards's struggle, the hospital's challenges, the medical innovations. The structure is hospital drama—each episode brings new cases and crises. The drive is constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons. The second season ends with Thackery's fate ambiguous. A third season was planned but never made. The show is excellent but incomplete. The medical drama at its finest.</p>
