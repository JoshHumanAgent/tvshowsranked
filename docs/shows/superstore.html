<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Cloud 9 is a big-box store in St. Louis. The employees are working class and underpaid. America Ferrera is Amy: the floor supervisor with dreams. Justin Spitzer created retail as found family—this is what work looks like for millions.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>America Ferrera as Amy. Ben Feldman as Jonah: the rich kid working retail. The ensemble captures the diversity of retail workers—immigrants, students, lifers.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Cloud 9: the store, the break room, the warehouse, the customers. The world is retail reality—understaffed, underpaid, essential.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>Single-camera sitcom: bright store lighting, the visual language of workplace comedy. Functional.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is a store. The "spectacle" is watching people work retail jobs with dignity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Working class America, labor unions, retail as career, immigration. The show explores these through comedy—sometimes sharply.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Amy's career; the will-they-won't-they; labor organizing. The structure is sitcom episodic with serialized threads.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Six seasons, complete. The union storyline resolves; relationships resolve. A satisfying workplace comedy ending.</p></div></section>
