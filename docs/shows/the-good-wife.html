            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Alicia Florrick stands beside her husband—State's Attorney caught with prostitutes—while the cameras roll. Then she goes back to work. Julianna Margulies is Alicia: humiliated, determined, building a career while her marriage collapses. Michelle and Robert King created network television's smartest legal drama: case-of-the-week plus serialized politics, technology, and one woman's reinvention.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Julianna Margulies anchors the show with controlled intensity. Christine Baranski as Diane Lockhart is iconic. Josh Charles as Will Gardner provides the romantic and professional tension. Alan Cumming as Eli Gold is the political operative we can't stop watching. The guest stars are a who's who of New York theater.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Chicago law and politics: the firm, the State's Attorney's office, the governor's mansion, the tech startups. The world evolves across seven seasons—Google-adjacent tech, NSA surveillance, the gig economy. The Kings use the case-of-the-week format to explore contemporary issues.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Network TV production values: the courtrooms, the firm offices, the political events. The style is functional—the writing and acting are the show. The visual language is competent without distinguishing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is law: courtrooms, depositions, political events. The "spectacle" is the writing—the episodes about technology, the NSA, the Apple stand-in, the Bitcoin stand-in. Intellectual spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The series explores: privacy in the digital age, the gig economy, surveillance capitalism, political corruption, marriage and power, women's choices. Each case-of-the-week illuminates a contemporary debate. The show is network TV's smartest exploration of modern life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Case-of-the-week with serialized arcs: Alicia's career, her marriage, the firm's politics, the elections. The structure allows both procedural satisfaction and long-term development. The drive is constant—every episode advances something.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Seven seasons with conclusion. The finale brings Alicia to a new place—not happy, not sad, different. The ending is appropriate: she stands alone again, but now it's her choice. The Kings knew when to stop.</p>
