            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Jang Bong-hwan is a modern-day chef working for the president. An accident sends his soul back in time into the body of Queen Cheorin in Joseon-era Korea. Now he's a queen, with a king who suspects something is wrong, a royal court full of schemers, and no idea how to behave like a 19th-century noblewoman. Historical fusion comedy: modern sensibility collides with court politics, and everything is funny.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Shin Hye-sun is remarkable as the queen possessed by a modern man: the walk, the speech patterns, the inappropriate commentary. Kim Jung-hyun as King Cheoljong plays the straight man with hidden depths. The court ensemble provides intrigue and comedy. The performances balance broad comedy with actual stakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Joseon court: the palace, the politics, the Andong Kim clan's dominance, the queen's quarters. The historical setting is researched and rendered with K-drama spectacle. Bong-hwan's modern perspective highlights the absurdities of court life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama historical production: lavish costumes, palace sets, period detail. The comedy is visual as well as verbal—Bong-hwan's modern mannerisms in royal couture. The style supports both comedy and drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Historical spectacle: the palace, the ceremonies, the costumes. K-drama budget shows on screen. The spectacle serves the comedy—the more elaborate the setting, the more ridiculous Bong-hwan's behavior appears.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Gender, modernity vs. tradition, power in court politics. The show touches on these but prioritizes comedy. The body swap is premise, not theme. This is entertainment first.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Court intrigue with comedy: the king is not as simple as he seems, the queen must survive, the political factions maneuver. The drive is episodic comedy with serialized stakes. K-drama momentum—every episode advances multiple plots.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete in 20 episodes. The body swap resolves, the politics resolve, the romance resolves. K-drama structure provides a complete story with satisfaction.</p>
