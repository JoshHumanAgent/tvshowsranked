            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Marty Byrde is a financial advisor who launders money for a Mexican cartel. When his partner steals, Marty must move his family to the Ozarks and launder $500 million in five years. Jason Bateman is Marty—calm, calculating, increasingly desperate. Laura Linney is Wendy, his wife who becomes more dangerous than he is. Breaking Bad meets better spouses: ordinary people becoming criminals.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Jason Bateman as Marty is controlled panic—his face barely moves but you feel the terror. Laura Linney as Wendy is the revelation: the housewife who discovers she's better at crime than her husband. Julia Garner as Ruth is iconic—the local who becomes family. The ensemble is excellent; Linney and Garner are Emmy-winners.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The Ozarks: lakeside resorts, local criminals, cartel enforcers, FBI surveillance. The world expands across seasons—the Kansas City mob, the Navarro cartel, the local crime families. The lake is character; Missouri is mapped.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production: the lake is beautiful, the violence is brutal, the tension is visual. The style is muted—greys and blues—reflecting the moral decay. The direction (Bateman directs many episodes) is controlled.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the lake and the violence: boat chases, cartel executions, desperate transactions. The "spectacle" is watching ordinary people become monsters. The production value is high; the ambition is character.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Family as justification, whether we become our choices, the American Dream as criminal enterprise. The show explores how good people justify evil when their family is threatened. The themes deepen across seasons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Marty must launder money to survive. Each season has new threats: cartels, FBI, local criminals. The drive is constant—Marty is always one mistake from death. The pacing is propulsive; the tension is relentless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with definitive ending. The finale resolves the Byrde family's story with appropriate darkness. The ending is controversial—some found it fitting, others wanted more consequence. Complete.</p>
