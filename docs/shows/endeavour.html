            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1960s Oxford. Endeavour Morse is a young detective constable with a first-class degree, a love of opera, and social skills that alienate colleagues. Shaun Evans plays Morse before Inspector Morse, before the cynicism fully hardens. Roger Allam is Thursday, his mentor. Russell Lewis's prequel captures the original's atmosphere—Oxford spires, classical music, murder in the quadrangle—while adding period detail: the Beatles, the pill, the end of capital punishment.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Shaun Evans becomes Morse—same character, different actor, complete believability. He captures the brilliance, the loneliness, the sensitivity that John Thaw showed us aged. Roger Allam as Thursday is the mentor Morse needed. The supporting cast (James Bradshaw, Sean Rigby) creates the Oxford City Police. The casting is flawless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1960s Oxford rendered with precision: the colleges, the punting, the department stores, the social conventions. The period evolves across seasons—the early 60s give way to the late, the cultural shifts visible in hair and music. The world of Inspector Morse, built from the past forward.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Oxford is photographed beautifully: golden stone, cobblestone streets, the river. The period is accurate without being museum-stuffy. Barrington Pheloung's Morse theme adapts and expands. The visual language connects directly to Inspector Morse—it's clearly the same world.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: Oxford architecture, vintage cars, costumes. The crimes are staged in classic British mystery style—bodies discovered, investigations conducted. This is not spectacle television; it's atmosphere television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Class, education, belonging. Morse is working-class at Oxford, educated among the elite without being of them. The show explores the outsider perspective—the detective who solves crimes because he notices what others miss. The period politics provide background: women's rights, capital punishment, police corruption.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Films (not episodes): each is 90+ minutes, each a complete mystery. The structure is classic British detective drama—a body, an investigation, red herrings, resolution. The serialized character development (Morse's relationships, Thursday's ethics) runs underneath. Patient viewing rewarded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Nine series, complete. The final episodes bridge perfectly to Inspector Morse—the trajectory is visible, the future is clear. The prequel enhances the original rather than diminishing it. One of television's best companion pieces.</p>
