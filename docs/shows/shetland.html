            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez works murders on the Shetland Islands—closer to Norway than Scotland. The islands are beautiful and isolated; the community is close-knit; everyone knows everyone. Douglas Henshall is Perez—quiet, competent, carrying loss. Ann Cleeves' novels adapted into Scottish noir: the landscape is as important as the crimes, and the crimes are always personal.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Douglas Henshall's Perez is the Scottish detective tradition extended: dour, dedicated, the quiet man who notices. Alison O'Donnell as Tosh provides the partnership. The supporting cast creates the island community—everyone has history, everyone has secrets. The performances are grounded and authentic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Shetland: the islands, the sea, the limited daylight, the isolation, the Nordic heritage. The world is specific—this isn't generic Scotland, it's the northernmost islands with their own culture. The landscape is constant; the weather shapes every investigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The Shetland Islands photographed as character: the cliffs, the sea, the small towns, the long summer light and winter dark. The landscape is majestic and melancholic. BBC Scotland production at its finest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the islands: the landscape, the isolation, the sea. The crimes are personal, not cinematic. The "spectacle" is atmosphere—watching the landscape shape the people who shape the crimes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Isolation, community, family secrets, the weight of history, the limits of escape. The islands trap people physically and emotionally. The show explores what happens when everyone knows everyone's business.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Multi-episode mysteries: each case takes 2-4 episodes, allowing the landscape and community to develop. The pacing is deliberate—this is slow-burn crime, not procedural. The drive is understanding what the isolation did to people.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues with new lead detective after Henshall's departure. Each story resolves; the series continues. Currently in transition, maintaining the setting and tone.</p>
