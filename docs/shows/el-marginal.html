            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                An ex-cop goes undercover in an Argentine prison to rescue a judge's daughter from the powerful mafia inside. But the prison has its own hierarchies, its own rules, its own betrayals. Juan Minujín is Miguel, caught between duty and survival. The prison thriller as Argentinian social commentary: corruption, inequality, violence as currency. Multiple seasons expand beyond the prison walls, but the heart is inside San Onofre—where everyone's guilty of something.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Juan Minujín as Miguel is compelling—his cover identity becoming something like real. The prison population is distinct: the Borges brothers, the powerful Mario, everyone with loyalties and debts. The performances are raw, Argentinian in intensity—emotions worn on sleeves, violence sudden and brutal. Authentic and committed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>San Onofre prison as microcosm: cell blocks, hierarchies, guards who can be bought, justice that doesn't exist. The world expands to Buenos Aires outside—slums, elite neighborhoods, the justice system that serves power. The show captures Argentinian inequality as lived experience. Specific, credible, educational.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Prison drama aesthetics: tight spaces, harsh light, blood on concrete. The style serves the content without pretension. The violence is visible, the conditions are vivid. Outside the prison, Buenos Aires is photographed with its own character. Television craft at high level.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is violence: prison fights, stabbings, the brutal enforcement of hierarchy. The production doesn't flinch. The spectacle is also emotional—betrayals, loyalties tested, the cost of survival. Not stylized; effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Incarceration, corruption, the blurred line between criminal and law enforcement. The show explores how prisons create criminals, how power works in contained spaces, how loyalty becomes survival strategy. Argentinian political context provides depth without requiring knowledge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season is propulsive: rescue the girl, survive the prison, maintain cover. Subsequent seasons expand the story beyond the walls, sometimes losing momentum but regaining it. Each season has a trajectory; the binge structure works well. Multiple seasons, consistent tension.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with conclusion. The rescue mission completes; the larger conspiracy resolves. Miguel's journey has endpoints across seasons. The show knows when to end. Resolution satisfies without betraying the darkness.</p>
