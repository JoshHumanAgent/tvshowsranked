            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Sarah Manning watches a woman who looks exactly like her commit suicide. She takes the dead woman's identity, hoping for easy money. Instead she discovers she's a clone—and there are more of her. Tatiana Maslany plays Sarah, Alison, Cosima, Helena, Rachel, and others, each distinct, each central to the conspiracy. The science is questionable; the commitment is total. Clone thriller as virtuoso acting showcase.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Tatiana Maslany's performance is historic: multiple characters, multiple accents, characters playing other characters, scenes where clones interact seamlessly. The technical achievement is only half of it—each clone is a real person with distinct psychology. The supporting cast (Jordan Gavaris as Felix, Maria Doyle Kennedy as Mrs. S) provides grounding. Emmy finally came; the performance remains legendary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Clone conspiracy: the science (Project Leda, Neolution), the corporate interests (Dyad Institute), the religious fanatics (Proletheans). The world expands across seasons—more clones, more conspiracies, more science. The world-building is elaborate; plausibility is secondary to momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The clone effects are invisible—you believe Maslany is talking to herself. The style is thriller: dark interiors, chases, confrontations. The direction serves Maslany's performance rather than distracting from it. Technical excellence in service of acting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Occasional action sequences: chases, fights, confrontations. Helena's violent missions provide spectacle. But the real show is Maslany performing multiple characters in single scenes. The spectacle is performance, not production.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Bodily autonomy, corporate ownership of life, identity and sisterhood. The themes are present—the clones are property, fighting for freedom—but the show prioritizes thriller momentum over philosophical depth. The ideas are interesting; the execution is plot-driven.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Serialized thriller: each episode reveals more conspiracy, more clones, more danger. The drive is constant—what will Sarah discover next? The show balances episodic stakes with serialized arc. Binge television before binge was standard.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with conclusion. The conspiracy is unraveled; the clones find varying degrees of resolution; Sarah protects her daughter. The ending is appropriate to the material. Maslany's performance carries any weaknesses in plot resolution.</p>
