            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Six strangers live in a house together: three men, three women, all attractive, all pursuing dreams in Tokyo. There's no script, no competitions, no eliminations. Just life: cooking dinner, going to work, developing crushes that may or may not be reciprocated. A panel of commentators watches and jokes. That's it. That's the show. The most relaxing television ever made, until it becomes unexpectedly compelling.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Real people, not actors: models, singers, athletes, entrepreneurs. Each season's cast creates a different dynamic. Some members are unforgettable (Hanayama, Seina, Lauren); others blend together. The panel provides running commentary that's often funnier than the house action. The authenticity is the point—you're watching real personalities develop.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The house is the world: a beautiful shared space in Tokyo. Each season has a different location—Opening New Doors in Karuizawa, Tokyo 2019-2020 in the city. The members' jobs and dreams provide external context: modeling agencies, music venues, boxing gyms. The world expands through their real lives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Reality TV production: cameras in corners, confessionals, the panel's studio. The style is invisible—it doesn't intrude on the "reality." Some moments are captured beautifully; others are mundane. The aesthetic is clean, Japanese, unpretentious.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people cooking, cleaning, working, talking. The spectacle is human: watching someone realize their crush isn't interested, watching a dream succeed or fail. Reality TV as observation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Japanese social dynamics: indirect communication, obligation, the performance of harmony. The show captures how people coexist without conflict, how romance develops through subtle signals. But it's not analytical—the concepts emerge from observation. Philosophy of the mundane.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>No artificial drive—what happens, happens. But human dynamics create momentum: Will they get together? Will the dream succeed? The panel's commentary provides structure. The lack of manufactured drama allows real moments to feel meaningful. Slow burn, genuine rewards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>No resolution—members leave when their goals are met (or abandoned); new members arrive. Each season has natural arcs as members come and go. The show was cancelled after a member's suicide (Hana Kimura)—tragedy intruding on the gentle format. The show exists in fragments, each season complete in itself.</p>
