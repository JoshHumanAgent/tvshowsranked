            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">The Last Thing He Told Me is a mystery about a woman whose husband disappears, leaving behind a note that says "Protect her" referring to his teenage daughter from a previous relationship. The seven-episode adaptation of Laura Dave's novel follows Hannah as she tries to understand who her husband actually was while navigating a complicated stepmother-stepdaughter relationship that the crisis forces into unexpected intimacy.</p>

            <p>Jennifer Garner plays Hannah with a steadiness that anchors the show's emotional stakes. The performance captures both the shock of discovering your partner was someone else entirely and the determination to protect a child you didn't choose but have come to love. The mystery elements—the husband's past, the FBI investigation, the reasons for his disappearance—provide structure, but the show's interest is really in the relationship between Hannah and stepdaughter Bailey.</p>

            <p>Where the series falters is in its resolution, which requires coincidences and character decisions that don't quite earn their emotional payoff. The book's ending was controversial, and the adaptation doesn't solve its problems. But as a study in forced family formation, in the stepmother-stepdaughter dynamic that shifts from hostility to alliance, the show has genuine moments. It's comfort-mystery, the kind of limited series that works well enough while you're watching but doesn't linger.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>The Last Thing He Told Me earns its position through committed performances and a central relationship that generates real investment. The score reflects a mystery that resolves less satisfyingly than it sets up.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Jennifer Garner carries the show with a performance that communicates emotional processing in real time. Angourie Rice as Bailey captures teenage hostility and gradual thawing without cliché. The missing husband, seen in flashbacks, is a presence without being a character, which is appropriate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show creates a convincing domestic sphere that's disrupted by external forces. The husband's former life is sketched rather than developed, and the mystery elements feel functional rather than atmospheric. The locations serve the story without becoming characters themselves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach is functional thriller—clean compositions, natural locations, a style that doesn't call attention to itself. The flashbacks to the marriage are shot warmer than the present-day investigation, creating clear temporal markers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>This is domestic mystery without action sequences or visual effects. The spectacle is entirely emotional—the faces of women sorting through a life that turns out to have been a lie. The visual interest is limited.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages with questions about identity and whether we can truly know the people we love. The stepmother-stepdaughter dynamic adds depth to the standard missing-person plot. But the themes don't transcend the mystery structure; they're present but not developed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The mystery structure provides momentum—who was he, where did he go, what does "protect her" mean? Each episode reveals something that changes Hannah's understanding, and the seven-episode count keeps things focused.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending requires accepting coincidences and character decisions that the story hasn't earned. The mystery resolves, but not in a way that feels satisfying given the setup. The emotional reunion between Hannah and Bailey works, but the plot mechanics don't.</p>
