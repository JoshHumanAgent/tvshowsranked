            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Columbo for the streaming era. Charlie Cale has a gift: she can tell when anyone is lying. She drives across America, working odd jobs, stumbling into murders she can't ignore. Natasha Lyonne is the detective who doesn't want to be one—cigarette-voiced, human lie detector, compulsive truth-seeker. Rian Johnson creates a classic procedural engine: inverted mystery (we see the crime), guest stars, weekly resolution. Old-school television made new, and made with love.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Natasha Lyonne is perfect—the voice, the attitude, the unexpected vulnerability beneath the bravado. Each episode features new guest actors: Judith Light, Adrien Brody, Chloë Sevigny, Hong Chau. The guest roster is Emmy-caliber. Lyonne anchors the show; the guests elevate each episode. The formula showcases performances.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Working-class America: diners, retirement homes, used car lots, regional theaters. Charlie moves through spaces that feel authentically American—motel rooms, gas stations, the places between places. The world accumulates across episodes as Charlie drives, never settling. The road trip as television structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode is shot like a small film—distinctive locations, clear compositions, murder sequences staged with Rian Johnson's characteristic precision. The "howcatchem" structure allows visual creativity—we know who did it; the pleasure is watching Charlie figure it out. Classic filmmaking, modern production value.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is in the murders and their environments—not blockbuster sequences, but clever staging. A death in a retirement home, a scheme at a BBQ joint, a body in a meat locker. The spectacle serves the mystery. Modest but effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Truth and lies, justice for the dead, the compulsion to investigate. The show explores what happens when you can't ignore deception—but the themes are light, secondary to the weekly pleasures. This is comfort television with a detective engine, not philosophy in mystery clothing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic perfection. Each episode is self-contained, with serialized elements (the casino owner hunting Charlie) running underneath. The classic procedural structure works—investigation, revelation, resolution. The formula doesn't tire because each episode brings new location, new crime, new guest stars. Television as weekly pleasure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show's format resists traditional resolution—Charlie drives on, cases end, the road continues. Whether it will achieve the mythic status of its inspirations depends on longevity. Format is proven; trajectory remains open.</p>
