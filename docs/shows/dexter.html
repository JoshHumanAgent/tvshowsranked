            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro Homicide. He's also a serial killer who only kills other killers. His adoptive father recognized his dark impulses and taught him to channel them. Michael C. Hall created one of television's greatest antiheroes: the monster we root for, the killer with a code.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Michael C. Hall as Dexter is extraordinary: the blankness that becomes personality, the violence beneath the charm, the journey from sociopath to something like human. Jennifer Carpenter as Debra provides the emotional heart. The supporting cast (Julie Benz, David Zayas, James Remar) creates Miami's homicide world. Hall's narration is iconic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Miami homicide: the department, the crime scenes, the nightlife where Dexter hunts. The world expands across seasons: other serial killers, the Triad, religious cults. The Miami setting provides heat and moral decay.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Showtime production: Miami photographed as both paradise and hunting ground. The kill room is its own aesthetic—clean, clinical, theatrical. The style serves Dexter's perspective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the ritual: the kill rooms, the plastic wrap, the instruments, the trophies. Dexter's kills are staged as art. The violence is intimate rather than grand.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Nature vs. nurture, the possibility of redemption for the irredeemable, whether the code is morality or control, the meaning of family. The show explores what happens when a sociopath tries to become human. The themes are present in Dexter's journey.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a Big Bad: the Ice Truck Killer, Lila, the Trinity Killer. The drive is Dexter's double life—the investigation, the kills, the close calls. Seasons 1 and 4 are peak; others vary. The structure provides momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight seasons with one of television's most reviled finales. Season 4's Trinity Killer storyline is among TV's best; the later seasons declined. The finale betrayed fan expectations so badly it spawned a revival (Dexter: New Blood) years later. The ending defines the conversation.</p>
