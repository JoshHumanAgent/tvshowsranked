<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Clark Kent in high school. He's not Superman yet. He's learning about his powers, fighting meteor freaks, hiding his identity from Lana and Chloe. The show that started the superhero TV boom: "no tights, no flights."</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Tom Welling as Clark: earnest farm boy becoming hero. Michael Rosenbaum as Lex: the friendship that becomes rivalry. Allison Mack as Chloe; Kristen Kreuk as Lana. The cast grows over ten seasons.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Smallville, Kansas: the farm, the town, the Luthor mansion, the Daily Planet. The world expands from high school to Metropolis, from episodic to serialized.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>WB/CW production: Vancouver for Kansas, the visual language of 2000s superhero TV. Functional but dated.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>Super speed, heat vision, Kryptonite effects. The spectacle improved over ten seasons but remained TV-scale.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Identity, responsibility, the cost of secrets, Lex's descent. The show explores Superman mythology through adolescence.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Villain of the week + mythology building. The drive is Clark becoming Superman.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Ten seasons, complete. Clark becomes Superman in the finale. Earned conclusion to decade-long journey.</p></div></section>
