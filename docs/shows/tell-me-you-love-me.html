            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Tell Me You Love Me is an intimate drama about couples in therapy, and it doesn't look away from the difficulty of maintaining connection over time. Three couples at different stages—newly dating, married with children, married for decades—navigate the gap between what they want from relationships and what they're actually experiencing. The show is notable for its frank treatment of sexuality and its willingness to let characters be unlikeable while still deserving empathy.</p>

            <p>The therapy sessions are where the show comes alive. Watching people try to articulate what's wrong, watching them fail to hear each other, watching the therapist navigate the space between what people say and what they mean—these scenes have a documentary quality that transcends the soap-opera elements. The actors bring vulnerability that makes the awkwardness feel real rather than performed.</p>

            <p>Where the show struggles is in balancing its three storylines. Some couples are more compelling than others, and the show sometimes feels like it's spreading itself thin. But when it works, it captures something rare on television: the ordinary tragedy of people who love each other but can't seem to make it work. The ten-episode count is a mercy—this is material that would become repetitive over a longer run, but as a limited exploration of couples in crisis, it has genuine power.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Tell Me You Love Me earns its ranking through frankness, committed performances, and a willingness to explore relationship difficulty without easy resolution. The score reflects a show that takes its subject seriously even when it doesn't fully cohere.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The cast commits to material that requires emotional nakedness. The therapy scenes are performances within performances—characters trying to present themselves while the actors show us what's actually happening. Some couples are better developed than others, but the overall quality is high.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The world is contemporary Los Angeles, rendered through apartments, therapy offices, and the particular spaces where relationships happen. The settings are functional rather than atmospheric, serving the characters without becoming characters themselves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach is intimate—close-ups that capture micro-expressions, handheld cameras in therapy sessions that create a sense of eavesdropping. The aesthetic matches the content: unvarnished, present, focused on faces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>There is no spectacle. This is interpersonal drama shot in rooms. The visual interest is entirely in watching people interact, in the small moments when someone realizes something about themselves or their partner.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages seriously with what intimacy requires, how desire changes over time, and the difficulty of maintaining connection. It doesn't offer solutions, but it raises questions that matter. The therapy framework allows for explicit discussion of themes that most shows only dramatize.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The therapy-session structure provides shape, but the show lacks conventional plot momentum. Progress is measured in small realizations rather than dramatic developments. Viewers expecting narrative propulsion may find the pace too gentle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The ten episodes provide stopping points rather than resolutions. Some couples make progress; others don't. The show understands that relationship problems don't end neatly, but this can feel unsatisfying for viewers seeking closure.</p>
