            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The Gemstones are America's most famous televangelist family. Eli (John Goodman) built the empire; his children Jesse (Danny McBride), Judy (Edi Patterson), and Kelvin (Adam Devine) are supposed to inherit it. They're also vain, petty, corrupt, and constantly at war with each other. McBride created a satire that became something more: a family drama about damage, faith, and whether the children of giants can ever be anything but disappointments.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Danny McBride as Jesse is brilliant: the eldest son desperate for respect, the failure who might not be. Edi Patterson as Judy is the show's secret weapon—wild, inappropriate, breaking every rule. John Goodman brings gravity to Eli. Adam Devine, Walton Goggins, the returning guest stars—everyone commits fully to the absurdity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Megachurch empire: the private jets, the compound, the amusement parks, the merchandising. The world is obscenely wealthy and convincingly realized. The church politics, the rivalries between ministries, the local power structures—all grounded in the reality of American evangelicalism.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production values: the compound looks real, the jets look expensive, the church looks like a stadium. The style is heightened reality—everything slightly too big, too bright, too much. The visual language matches the satire.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is wealth: the compound, the jets, the church productions. The action sequences (and there are a few) are staged with comedic precision. The "spectacle" is the Gemstones' extravagance, photographed without apology.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Faith and commerce, family and inheritance, the children of titans, whether hypocrisy invalidates the message. The show takes faith seriously even as it satirizes its commodification. The Gemstones are corrupt; they also believe. The complexity is the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has external threats: blackmailers, rivals, government investigations. But the real drive is internal: can this family survive each other? The pacing is McBride's signature—slow burns interrupted by explosions of consequence. Bingeable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues to develop the Gemstones' evolution. Each season provides resolution to its arc while setting up the next. No clear endpoint announced. Currently delivering quality comedy-drama.</p>
