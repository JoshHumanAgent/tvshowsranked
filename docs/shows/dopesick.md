## What It Feels Like to Watch

In the 1990s, a pharmaceutical company called Purdue Pharma introduced OxyContin — a painkiller they claimed was less addictive than other opioids. *Dopesick* tells the true story of how that lie devastated America.

This is not easy viewing. The show spans multiple storylines: the Purdue executives (Michael Keaton is extraordinary as Richard Sackler); the doctors who were deceived; the DEA agents who tried to stop it; and the communities that were destroyed. It's a mosaic of American tragedy.

The performances are exceptional. Michael Keaton delivers career-best work as the charismatic but amoral Sackler. The supporting cast includes Peter Sarsgaard, Michael Stuhlbarg, and the excellent Kaitlyn Dever as a coal miner turned addict.

The show doesn't just tell a story — it makes an argument. It shows how corporations captured regulatory agencies, how doctors were misled, and how addiction was treated as a moral failing rather than a disease. It's damning and necessary.

This is one of the best limited series of recent years — important television that tells an important story.
