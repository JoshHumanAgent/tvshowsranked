## What It Feels Like to Watch

Victorian London, 1891. Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton) is searching for his missing daughter. Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) is an American gunslinger in over his head. Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadaway) is... well, he's Dr. Frankenstein. And they're all being hunted by something dark.

*Penny Dreadful* is a love letter to Gothic horror. Created by John Logan (the Oscar-winning screenwriter of *The Aviator* and *Gladiator*), it weaves together characters from Victorian literature — Frankenstein, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde — into an original story that's darker, sexier, and more complex than any of its source material.

The production is gorgeous: fog-shrouded London streets, ornate Victorian mansions, costumes that drip with atmosphere. The show looks like a period film, and it has the acting to match.

Eva Green is extraordinary as Vanessa Ives, a woman possessed by darkness, battling demons both literal and metaphorical. She anchors the show, bringing complexity to a character who could have been one-dimensional. Josh Hartnett is surprisingly effective as the haunted Ethan, a man with a violent past and a secret.

The show deals with addiction, sexuality, identity, and the nature of evil. It's not always comfortable viewing — some episodes venture into surprisingly dark territory — but it's never boring. The third and final season brings everything to a satisfying (if bittersweet) conclusion.

For fans of Gothic horror, this is required viewing.
