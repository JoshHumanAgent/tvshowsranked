            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Kate Ashby was rescued from the Rwandan genocide and adopted by a British prosecutor. As an adult, she works at her mother's legal firm, specializing in international criminal law. When a new case involves the genocide's aftermath, Kate's history collides with its present. Michaela Coel is Kate; Abi Morgan created this exploration of justice, memory, and where trauma goes when it doesn't end.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Michaela Coel's range is remarkable: the anger beneath the calm, the trauma beneath the competence. Harriet Walter as her adoptive mother is the professional mask to Kate's survivor truth. John Goodman as the American lawyer provides geopolitical context. The performances are committed, specific, unflinching.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>International criminal law as battlefield: the Hague, legal chambers, Africa's post-colonial politics, the NGOs that profit from crisis. The show creates a complete ecosystem: how genocide cases are built, how politics influences justice, how victims become evidence. Educational without being didactic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>International production: London, the Hague, Rwanda. The visual style is documentary-adjacent—clear, unpretentious, serving the story. Rwanda is photographed with respect for its beauty and its history. The aesthetic is legal thriller, not travelogue.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people in rooms discussing law, politics, history. The "spectacle" is emotional: watching survivors confront their past, watching institutions fail their purpose. Television as moral inquiry.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Justice vs. reconciliation, the ethics of international intervention, whether courts can heal nations. The show explores the Rwandan genocide's aftermath without simplification: who gets prosecuted, who doesn't, how politics shapes memory. Sophisticated, demanding, necessary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight episodes of legal investigation and personal discovery. The case provides structure; Kate's history provides urgency. The pacing is deliberate—this is complex material requiring attention. Rewards patient viewers; may frustrate those seeking action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The case concludes without simple resolution; Kate's journey toward understanding continues. The ending is honest: justice is imperfect, healing is ongoing, history doesn't end. Appropriate to the material.</p>
