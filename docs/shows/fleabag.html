<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A woman navigates London after her best friend's suicide. She's angry, horny, grieving. She breaks the fourth wall to let us in. Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote and stars in the adaptation of her one-woman show: grief as comedy, guilt as performance, connection as impossibility.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Fleabag: the audience is her confidant, her co-conspirator, her judge. Olivia Colman as the godmother: passive aggression perfected. Andrew Scott as the Hot Priest in season 2. The performances are among comedy's best.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>London: the café, the family, the failed relationships. The world is intimate—this is one woman's inner life externalized. The fourth wall makes us part of her world.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>BBC production: the direct address to camera, the observational comedy, the moments of stillness. The style serves the intimacy—Fleabag looks at us, and we can't look away.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is one woman's life: café, relationships, family dinners. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching grief transformed into comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Grief, guilt, female desire, self-sabotage, whether we can ever really know each other, what we hide vs. what we show. The show breaks television's rules to explore these.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>What happened to Boo? Can Fleabag forgive herself? The mystery deepens into grief. Season 2 adds: can she love and be loved? The drive is emotional.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Two seasons, perfect. The ending of season 2 is among television's best—the goodbye to the camera, the choice to live. Complete and essential.</p></div></section>
