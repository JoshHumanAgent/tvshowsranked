            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Kurt Wallander is a young police officer in Malmö. He investigates a murder that has personal connections. This is Wallander before the Henning Mankell novels—forming the detective he'll become. Adam Pålsson is the young Wallander: idealistic, damaged, becoming. Swedish noir for the Netflix era.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Adam Pålsson as young Wallander: forming the detective's instincts and damage. The supporting cast provides the cases and the personal connections. The performances are Nordic noir solid—understated, effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Malmö, Sweden: the immigrant neighborhoods, the police stations, the social tensions. The world is contemporary Sweden with all its contradictions. Nordic noir rendered with specificity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix Swedish production: Malmö photographed in muted colors, the crime scenes rendered with detail. The style is Scandinavian noir—grey, atmospheric, functional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is investigation: interviews, crime scenes, police work. The "spectacle" is the Swedish setting and the social commentary. Nordic noir is about mood, not spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Immigration and integration, Swedish identity, institutional corruption, the forming of a detective's worldview. The show explores the Sweden that made Wallander. Social commentary through crime.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season investigates a case with personal connection to Wallander. The structure is mystery: crime, investigation, revelation. The drive is the Nordic noir tradition—methodical, atmospheric.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled. The cases resolve but Wallander's journey is incomplete. The show was meant to bridge to the Mankell novels; it stopped before arriving. Incomplete.</p>
