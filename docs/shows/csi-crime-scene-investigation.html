            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Las Vegas crime scene investigators solve murders through forensic evidence. William Petersen is Gil Grissom: the entomologist leading the night shift. The show that made forensics cool: microscopic evidence, DNA breakthroughs, the science of catching killers. CSI spawned a franchise and influenced real forensic science.

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Network procedural: bright, clinical, the evidence rendered with visual effects. The style is science-as-spectacle—microscopes, DNA sequences, bullet trajectories. Dated but distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is forensic: evidence magnified, crime reconstructions, scientific revelations. The "spectacle" is the science—watching investigators find what others missed. Procedural spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Science vs. assumption, evidence doesn't lie, the importance of procedure. The show influenced real forensic science education. The themes are procedural; the impact was cultural.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Case of the week with limited serialization: each episode is a self-contained investigation. The structure is reliable—crime, evidence, solution. 337 episodes of consistency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>15 seasons with conclusion. Grissom left; Ted Danson led later seasons. The finale brought back original cast for proper goodbye. Complete within its format.</p>
