            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Sun-drenched Miami. A spy who's been disowned, stranded in his hometown, his mother's house, his past. Boca Raton meets Bourne. Each episode is a lesson in tradecraft narrated by a man who knows every trick. There's comfort in the formula: a client, a problem, a plan, execution. The heat never breaks. The sunglasses never come off. It's Magnum P.I. for the War on Terror era—competence porn disguised as television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Michael Westen is Jeffrey Donovan's signature role—a burn notice spy with special ops skills and a working-class Boston accent that never quite fits Miami. Sharon Gless as his mother Madeline is superb: chain-smoking, manipulative, genuinely loving. Bruce Campbell as Sam Axe brings B-movie charm. Gabrielle Anwar's Fiona is a believable ex-IRA operative with chemistry that never quite ignites. The ensemble is solid but never transcendent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spy world is filtered through Miami—a location that becomes as much character as setting. The show creates a consistent mythology: burn notices, handlers, agents, networks. But it's procedural world-building, designed to service weekly stories rather than accumulate into something larger. The mythology deepens across seasons, but never achieves the density of the great spy shows.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Miami looks beautiful, but the filmmaking is functional. USA Network shows have a house style—bright, fast, undemanding. The action beats are competent but not memorable. The spy-craft montages are the visual signature: Michael building a bug from RadioShack parts, showing you exactly how it works. Educational televison disguised as entertainment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Car chases, explosions, gunfights—the spectacle is present but TV-grade. This is cable television, not cinema. The spectacle is in the ingenuity, not the visuals: how Michael turns a microwave into a listening device, how Sam extracts information at a bar. The fireworks are character moments rather than action beats.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The concept is simple: burned spy helps people while searching for answers. Each episode teaches spy-craft—a conscious pedagogical choice. But there's limited thematic depth. This isn't exploring the ethics of espionage like The Americans; it's celebrating competence. Smart television that isn't particularly deep.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Burn Notice crackles. TheVoice of God narration keeps exposition moving, the cases of the week resolve efficiently, and the season-long arcs create forward momentum. It's designed to be watched—easy to start, easy to continue, satisfying to complete. Some shows make you work; this one works for you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Seven seasons with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The mystery of who burned Michael resolves satisfyingly. The final season brings closure without betraying the show's tone. It's not prestige TV's ambiguous ending—it's closure, earned and given. The show knows what it is and delivers exactly that, year after year.</p>
