<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Arabella is a writer whose drink is spiked. She can't remember what happened. She reconstructs the night, and the reconstruction changes everything. Michaela Coel created, wrote, directed, and stars: sexual assault explored with radical honesty, the aftermath as comedy-drama, trauma without easy resolution.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Michaela Coel as Arabella: the writer reconstructing her night. Weruche Opia as Terry: the best friend. Paapa Essiedu as Kwame: the friend with his own trauma. The performances are raw, specific, fearless.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>London's creative scene: the publishing industry, the bars, the friendships, the dating. The world is Arabella's community—supports and stresses, witnesses and participants.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>BBC/HBO production: London rendered with specificity, the night out reconstructed from fragments. The style serves the investigation—the camera helps Arabella remember.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is trauma: the reconstruction, the aftermath, the friendships. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching someone piece together what happened.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Consent, memory, trauma, whether we can heal, what we owe to our friends, how assault reshapes everything. The show explores these without simplification. Essential.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>What happened that night? Each episode is a reconstruction, a memory, a consequence. The structure is investigation—Arabella's mind, our understanding. The drive is truth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>One season, complete. The ending offers multiple possibilities—Arabella reclaims her narrative. The conclusion is radical and appropriate. Essential viewing.</p></div></section>
