            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">I May Destroy You is a limited series written, directed by, and starring Michaela Coel about a sexual assault survivor processing trauma with unsparing honesty. Coel plays Arabella, a writer who is drugged and assaulted in the first episode and spends the subsequent eleven episodes trying to understand what happened, who did it, and how to continue living. The show addresses consent, assault, and the complexity of surviving without becoming preachy or simplistic.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes the show is its radical honesty about ambivalence. Arabella is angry and confused. She wants justice but doesn't trust the institutions that should provide it. She seeks support from friends who have their own secrets and their own ways of processing trauma. The show explores the gray areas of sex, consent, and memory without abandoning the clear truth that what happened to Arabella was assault.</p>

            <p>Coel's performance is extraordinary, finding the humor in trauma without trivializing it, the strength in survival without sentimentalizing it. The show's formal experimentation—flashbacks that may not be memories, sequences that question reality, different timelines that suggest multiple truths—creates a structure appropriate to the subject: assault creates narrative unreliability, and the show dramatizes that experience rather than pretending trauma can simply be explained.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>I May Destroy You earns its ranking through Michaela Coel's multi-hyphenate achievement, radical honesty about trauma, and artistic risks that mostly land. The score reflects limited television at its most ambitious.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Michaela Coel gives a performance that's simultaneously raw, funny, angry, and vulnerable. She plays Arabella as brilliant but flawed, strong and broken at once. The supporting cast creates a full social world with their own struggles with consent, assault, and survival.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Contemporary London, the creative and literary scene, university life, and social spaces all feel specific and real. The world is familiar enough to be immediately recognizable while specific enough to have texture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The direction experiments with memory, flashback, and time in ways that serve the theme of trauma. Some sequences are formally audacious. The look is contemporary and intimate without calling attention to itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. The show's power comes entirely from performances and writing. Visual interest is in faces and emotional reactions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (8.5/10)</h3>
                <p>This is a show about consent, trauma, memory, and survival. It explores the gray areas of sexual encounters, the failures of institutional response, and how people piece together lives after assault without simplifying difficult questions. The conceptual exploration is inseparable from the emotional narrative.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Arabella's investigation into her assault provides momentum, but the show resists simple mystery structure. Each episode advances understanding without necessarily advancing plot. The twelve-episode count allows depth but some viewers found certain episodes divergent.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The finale refuses easy justice or closure, which is appropriate to the subject. The resolution is emotional rather than plot-based. Some viewers wanted more definitive endings; others appreciated the refusal of simple resolution.</p>
