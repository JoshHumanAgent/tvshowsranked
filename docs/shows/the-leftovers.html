            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Two percent of the world's population disappeared instantly. No explanation. The show picks up three years later. Those left behind try to make sense of it. Tom Perrotta and Damon Lindelof created television's most profound exploration of grief: the mystery isn't the point, the living is.</p>
            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Justin Theroux as Kevin Garvey: the chief of police losing his mind. Carrie Coon as Nora Durst: the woman who lost everyone. Regina King, Christopher Eccleston, Amy Brenneman. The performances are among television's best. Coon is transcendent.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Post-Departure world: the Guilty Remnant cult, the grief industries, the families trying to continue. Each season shifts setting—the New York suburb, the Texas town, the Australian outback. The world is grief made manifest.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>HBO production: the suburb's despair, the Texas town's strange peace, Australia's apocalyptic beauty. The style evolves with the show—season 3 is almost religious. Max Richter's score haunts.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is grief: people trying to continue, cults forming, faith tested. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching people carry what cannot be carried.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Grief, faith, whether we can ever know what happened, what we owe to the missing, how we continue. The show explores the unexplainable without explaining. Profound.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Each season asks different questions. Season 1: how do we continue? Season 2: is there a new start? Season 3: what if there's an end? The structure is mystery, but the mystery is life.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Three seasons with perfect ending. The finale is among television's best—it answers while leaving mystery, completes while remaining open. The ending is the point.</p></div>
