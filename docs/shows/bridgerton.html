            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Regency London. The Bridgerton family navigates the marriage market. Each season focuses on a different sibling's romantic journey. Lady Whistledown's scandal sheet narrates. Shonda Rhimes adapts Julia Quinn's novels: period drama with modern sensibility, string quartet pop covers, diverse casting, and steamy romance.

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The Bridgerton siblings: Jonathan Bailey (Anthony), Phoebe Dynevor (Daphne), Nicola Coughlan (Penelope). Each season introduces new leads. The performances embrace the romance without camp. Regé-Jean Page's Simon Basset made season 1 iconic.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Regency London reimagined: the ballrooms, the drawing rooms, the ton. The world is fantasy history—diverse aristocracy, modern attitudes beneath period dress. The aesthetic is distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production at its most lavish: saturated colors, elaborate costumes, grand sets, the ballet of balls. The style is sumptuous—romance novel covers brought to life. Visual pleasure is the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the romance: the balls, the costumes, the weddings, the love scenes. Bridgerton is designed for visual pleasure. The production value matches the fantasy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Society and scandal, marriage as market, sisterhood, whether duty and desire can coexist. The show explores period constraints through modern values. Light themes, heavy pleasure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season is one sibling's romance: will they/won't they, obstacles, resolution. The structure is romance novel—the drive is the romantic tension. The serialized gossip (Lady Whistledown) provides mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Three seasons completed, more planned. Each season resolves its romance; the family story continues. Netflix blockbuster designed for continuation.</p>
