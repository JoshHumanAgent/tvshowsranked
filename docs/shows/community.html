<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Jeff Winger is a disbarred lawyer who enrolls at Greendale Community College to get an easy degree. He meets a study group. Dan Harmon created the most meta sitcom: parody of genres, layers of irony, the show that keeps commenting on itself.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Joel McHale as Jeff: narcissist with heart. Gillian Jacobs as Britta: the activist who doesn't know anything. Donald Glover as Troy, Danny Pudi as Abed. The ensemble created comedy gold.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Greendale: the community college as absurd universe, Dean Pelton, Chang, the paintball episodes. The world is anything-parody.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Network sitcom that becomes film parody. Each genre episode has its style.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is parody: action movies, documentaries, claymation. The "spectacle" is the concept.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Meta-humor, pop culture references, found family through college, redemption arcs. The show is about itself.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Jeff's degree; study group bonds. Episodic parodies with serialized character growth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Six seasons and a movie (eventually). The Yahoo! season ends the story. A meta ending for a meta show.</p></div></section>
