## What It Feels Like to Watch

Baltimore isn't just a setting—it's a living organism. The Wire isn't about cops and criminals; it's about systems. The police department, the drug trade, the docks, the schools, the newspaper. Each season peels back another layer of institutional failure.

You start watching for the crime drama—you stay for the profound meditation on American society. The show refuses easy answers. There are no heroes, only people trying to navigate impossible systems. McNulty is brilliant but self-destructive. Stringer Bell is murderous but rational. Omar robs drug dealers with a shotgun and a code.

The experience is cumulative. You won't love it immediately—it demands patience. But somewhere in season 2, when you're arguing about the port authority with strangers, you've become complicit. You've been absorbed into Baltimore's world.

The show is revolutionary in its approach to narrative. There's no protagonist in the traditional sense. The city is the protagonist. Every season shifts focus—from law enforcement to the drug trade to the docks to the schools to the media—creating a tapestry of institutional failure that feels like reading a great American novel.
