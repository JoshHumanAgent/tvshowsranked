            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                West Texas oil fields. A landman—the person who negotiates mineral rights between landowners and oil companies—navigates the boom-bust cycles of American energy. Billy Bob Thornton is the fixer caught between corporate interests, local communities, and his own complicated family. Taylor Sheridan's universe expands again: rugged individualism, capitalism as frontier, men who build things and the systems that consume them. The Permian Basin rendered as modern Wild West.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Billy Bob Thornton brings weary authority to the landman role—he's done everything, seen everything, keeps going anyway. The supporting cast includes Ali Larter, Michelle Randolph, and Jon Hamm in a recurring capacity. The performances are professional, occasionally elevated. Thornton carries the show; the ensemble provides texture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Oil country as character: the rigs, the roads, the boomtowns, the money flowing through communities that have little else. The show explains the industry—how oil gets from ground to gas station, who profits, who suffers. The world is educational in the best way: you understand systems by watching people navigate them. Sheridan excels at making economics dramatic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Texas landscape as canvas: vast skies, endless roads, industrial equipment silhouetted against sunset. The photography captures both the beauty and the blight—prairie transformed by extraction. The visual language is consistent with Sheridan's other work: naturalism heightened, America photographed in its working clothes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is industrial: rigs drilling, wells catching fire, explosions contained and uncontained. The show renders the dangerous beauty of oil work—men and machines conquering geology for profit. Not blockbuster spectacle, but spectacle of a specific American industry filmed with respect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Energy, extraction, the cost of American prosperity. The show explores who benefits from oil wealth and who pays—environmentally, socially, personally. The landman exists between worlds: corporations and communities, profit and principle. The themes are Sheridan's recurring concerns: capitalism as violence, masculinity as performance, family as burden and salvation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic crises with serialized character development. Each episode brings a new negotiation, a new disaster, a new complication. The pacing is deliberate—Sheridan's shows build slowly, trust patience. The drive accumulates rather than accelerates. Viewers seeking rapid resolution may be frustrated; viewers who appreciate world immersion will be rewarded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Too early to judge resolution. The first season establishes characters and conflicts without clear endpoints. Whether the show builds toward conclusion or settles into endless process remains to be seen. Potential exists; trajectory is unclear.</p>
