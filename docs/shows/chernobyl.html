            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>Chernobyl is horror without monsters. The miniseries tells the story of the 1986 nuclear disaster, not as a thriller about atomic energy, but as a study in how systems fail. It's about what happens when ideology meets physics and loses—when a state built on the impossibility of error confronts an error so colossal it cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>Jared Harris plays Valery Legasov, the nuclear physicist who understands immediately that Reactor 4 has exploded and who spends the rest of the series trying to limit the damage. Harris is perfect: a man of science facing a catastrophe caused by men who thought science served ideology. His testimony in the final episode is one of television's great monologues—quiet, devastating, a summation of everything the show has been saying about truth and consequence.</p>
            <p>Stellan Skarsgård plays Boris Shcherbina, the Soviet apparatchik sent to manage the crisis. His transformation from party loyalist to someone who understands what's at stake mirrors the viewer's journey. He begins by dismissing Legasov, ends by defending him. The bureaucracy that made him powerful becomes the bureaucracy he must fight.</p>
            <p>Emily Watson plays Ulana Khomyuk, a fictional composite of the Soviet scientists who worked to understand and contain the disaster. She's our proxy—the investigator who refuses to accept official explanations, who tracks down witnesses, who pieces together what really happened in the control room. Watson plays her with fierce intelligence and moral clarity.</p>
            <p>The show's most remarkable achievement is making radiation visible. The Geiger counter clicks become a soundtrack of dread. The increasing numbers on dosimeters become a countdown. We see the hospital rooms where firefighters' skin sloughs off, the forests where animals are shot on sight, the tunnel that must be dug beneath the reactor. It's not gratuitous—it's the truth of what happened, presented with unflinching restraint.</p>
            <p>And through it all runs the question: What is the cost of lies? Every Soviet official who covered up earlier problems, every engineer who stayed silent to protect a career, every bureaucrat who chose the easy answer—they all contributed to the moment when control rods became graphite tips and the core became a bomb. The show is an argument that truth matters, that the cost of ignoring it accumulates, that physics doesn't negotiate.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>World Building (10):</strong> The Soviet Union in 1986 recreated with meticulous authenticity. The sets, costumes, language (English with accents), bureaucracy—everything feels right. The reactor itself becomes a character, something malevolent and indifferent.</p>
            <p><strong>Conceptual Density (10):</strong> The show explains nuclear physics, Soviet bureaucracy, the nature of truth, the cost of lies. It's educational without being didactic. Every piece of information serves the story.</p>
            <p><strong>Narrative Drive (10):</strong> Five episodes, no filler. Every scene matters. The countdown to the potential steam explosion, the race to drain the tanks, the miners tunneling beneath the core—each sequence builds tension without manipulation.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution (10):</strong> The trial in the final episode provides closure without false triumph. Legasov's testimony devastates. His fate is sealed. The cost of truth is measured against the cost of lies.</p>
