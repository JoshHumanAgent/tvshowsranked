<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">April 1986. Reactor 4 at Chernobyl explodes. The Soviet state tries to hide it. Scientists race to prevent worse. Craig Mazin's miniseries: the cost of lies, the heroism of ordinary people, catastrophe as human failure. Nuclear horror as documentary.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Jared Harris as Valery Legasov: the scientist who tells the truth. Stellan Skarsgård as Boris Shcherbina: the bureaucrat who learns to listen. Emily Watson as Ulana Khomyuk: the composite scientist representing truth-seekers. The performances are devastating.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>1986 Soviet Union: the reactor, the control room, Pripyat, the evacuation, the trial. The world is recreated with documentary precision. Every detail is researched. The radiation is invisible but present in every frame.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3><p>HBO production at its finest: the reactor explosion, the evacuation, the miners, the liquidators. The style is clinical horror—the camera observes catastrophe. The Geiger counter is the soundtrack.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is radiation made visible: the glowing core, the burning graphite, the bodies failing. The spectacle serves the truth—this is what happened.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>The cost of lies, state denial vs. scientific truth, what we owe to each other, heroism as duty, whether truth can survive power. The show is a thesis on denial and its consequences.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (10/10)</h3><p>The disaster unfolds, the cover-up fails, the truth emerges, the consequences mount. Each episode is escalation. The structure is countdown—the worst must be prevented.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Five episodes, perfect. The trial provides the structure. Legasov's testimony is the climax. The ending is devastating and complete. Essential television.</p></div></section>
