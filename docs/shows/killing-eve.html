<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Eve Polastri is an MI5 analyst obsessed with female assassins. Villanelle is a Russian assassin who kills with style. They become obsessed with each other—cat and mouse, attraction and violence. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer star in Phoebe Waller-Bridge's adaptation: spy thriller as black comedy.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Sandra Oh as Eve: the analyst becoming what she hunts. Jodie Comer as Villanelle: the assassin with style and humor. The chemistry between them defines the show. Comer's Villanelle is iconic.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>European espionage: MI5, the Twelve, the locations. The world serves the cat-and-mouse—the specifics matter less than the chase.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>BBC America production: European locations, fashion-forward assassin, the kills staged as dark comedy. The style is bright where spy thrillers are usually dark.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is Villanelle's kills: stylish, funny, brutal. Each assassination is a fashion shoot with death. The spectacle serves the character.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Obsession, the attraction to violence, whether hunter and hunted can love each other, identity as performance. The show explores these through black comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Eve hunts Villanelle. Villanelle hunts Eve. They meet. The drive is cat-and-mouse with romantic tension. Season 1 is perfect; later seasons vary.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>Four seasons. Season 1 is among the best television of its era. Seasons 2-4 diminish in quality. The finale disappointed many. The journey exceeds the destination.</p></div></section>
