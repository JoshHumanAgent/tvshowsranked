            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Rebecca Ferguson as Elizabeth Woodville: the commoner who becomes queen. Amanda Hale as Margaret Beaufort: the Lancastrian who will wait decades for her son. Faye Marsay as Anne Neville: the pawn who becomes player. The performances are stellar.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Wars of the Roses England: the courts, the battles, the marriages that determine kingdoms. The world is complete—15th century politics through women's eyes. The historical detail immerses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz/BBC co-production: period detail, the castles, the battles rendered with budget. The style is historical drama—sumptuous but focused on character.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the battles, the coronations, the court. The production value serves the history. Not epic spectacle but historical drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Women in history, marriage as politics, survival in a world of changing fortunes, what we sacrifice for our children. The show explores these through three very different women.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Elizabeth's rise, Margaret's patient plotting, Anne's journey from pawn to player. The structure is triptych—three stories converging on Bosworth. The drive is historical momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The Wars of the Roses end at Bosworth; the Tudor dynasty begins. The ending satisfies historically and emotionally. The White Princess continues the story.</p>
