            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Adam Kay's memoir adapted for television. Ben Whishaw is a junior doctor on an obstetrics ward in the NHS: 97-hour weeks, impossible decisions, gallows humor as survival mechanism. The show is by turns hilarious and devastating. One moment you're laughing at bureaucratic absurdity; the next you're watching a patient die. The NHS as love letter and cri de cœur.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Ben Whishaw is brilliant: the exhaustion, the black humor, the breaking point hidden beneath competence. Ambika Mod as Shruti, the even more junior doctor, provides the heart. The supporting cast creates the NHS as ecosystem—overworked, underfunded, essential. The performances are authentic and raw.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>NHS obstetrics ward: the endless patients, the bureaucratic hoops, the parking tickets, the vending machine dinners. The world is accurate—Kay worked as a doctor, and every detail rings true. The NHS is rendered as both miracle and crisis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>British TV production: functional, realistic, the hospital as workplace. The style doesn't call attention to itself—it serves the story. The direction captures both the chaos and the quiet moments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is a hospital ward: births, emergencies, paperwork. The "spectacle" is medical emergency, rendered without romanticization. Birth is messy; death is routine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The NHS crisis, the human cost of underfunding, the impossibility of being a good doctor under impossible conditions, the way systems fail both patients and practitioners. The show is political through personal—Adam's individual crisis is the NHS's collective crisis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Seven episodes, each a shift or a week. The structure follows Adam's decline: the jokes get darker, the mistakes happen, the breaking point approaches. The momentum is relentless—you know something is coming, you don't know what.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete. One season tells the story: the tragedy, its aftermath, Adam's departure from medicine. The ending is devastating and appropriate. A complete statement, not a franchise setup.</p>
