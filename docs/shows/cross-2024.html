            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Cross is a Korean crime thriller that follows a detective with a particular talent: an almost supernatural ability to read crime scenes, to see the violence that happened in a space by reading the physical evidence left behind. It's a familiar detective-show conceit—the brilliant but troubled investigator—but Cross executes it with enough style and emotional conviction that the familiarity doesn't matter as much as it might.</p>

            <p>The show creates its atmosphere through accumulation: crime scenes rendered in careful detail, the detective's process shown rather than explained, the gradual revelation of a pattern connecting seemingly disparate cases. The eight-episode run keeps things tight—there's no room for filler, and each episode advances both the case-of-the-week and the larger mystery. The violence is present but not gratuitous; Cross is interested in the psychology of crime rather than its gore.</p>

            <p>Where the show struggles is in its final act, when the pattern resolves into a conspiracy that feels designed rather than discovered. The resolution requires accepting coincidences and convenient revelations that the tight early episodes didn't need. The detective's talent is explained in a way that diminishes rather than enriches the character, and the emotional payoff doesn't quite match the buildup. Cross is a well-made thriller that doesn't stick the landing, a common problem in a genre that prizes setup over resolution.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Cross earns its ranking through strong atmosphere, committed performances, and a procedural structure that keeps momentum across its eight episodes. The lower scores for resolution and conceptual depth reflect a finale that doesn't match the quality of what came before. For crime-thriller fans, it provides eight hours of competent entertainment; for others, it's not essential viewing.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The lead performance carries the show—a detective whose gift is also a burden, who sees violence he can't unsee. The portrayal captures both competence and weariness effectively. Supporting characters are functional: the partner who grounds the lead, the superior who creates obstacles, the victims whose deaths drive the investigation. Adequate but not memorable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show creates a recognizable version of Korean policing: procedural details, institutional dynamics, the particular pressures of detective work. The crime scenes are the most developed spaces—each one conveying the violence that occurred without excessive illustration. The broader world remains underdeveloped; we see what's necessary for the investigation and little else.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Cross uses visual language effectively: crime scenes are shot with clinical distance that gradually warms as the detective reads them, the present giving way to implied past. The palette is desaturated, appropriate to the material. Key sequences—a nighttime pursuit through narrow streets, a confrontation in an abandoned building—are staged with skill.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Crime thrillers don't generally provide spectacle, and Cross follows that pattern. There are chases and confrontations, but the show's visual interest lies in observation rather than action. The spectacle is psychological—watching a mind work through evidence—rather than physical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages with questions about violence and its aftermath, about the cost of seeing too clearly. The detective's talent is framed as both gift and curse, and the toll it takes on his psychology is part of the story. The conspiracy finale diminishes these themes by providing external explanations for what worked better as character study.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The episodic structure—discovering new cases, seeing connections, pursuing leads—provides consistent momentum. The eight-episode count prevents padding; every scene serves either the immediate investigation or the larger arc. The pacing is one of the show's strengths, moving forward with purpose even when the destination proves disappointing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The finale resolves the central mystery but requires accepting conveniences that earlier episodes didn't need. The explanation for the detective's gift is a letdown, and the conspiracy reveal feels small compared to the crimes that preceded it. The emotional resolutions for the detective work better than the plot mechanics, but the overall landing is bumpier than the flight.</p>
