<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Ten thousand people live in a silo underground. The outside is toxic. They don't know why they're there or who built it. Juliette is an engineer who becomes sheriff and investigates. Hugh Howey's Wool adapted: dystopian mystery as escape thriller.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Rebecca Ferguson as Juliette: the engineer who keeps asking questions. The ensemble creates the silo's society. The performances capture the paranoia.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>The silo: the levels, the departments, the rules, the history. The world is a complete underground society—every level has purpose, every rule has reason. Mystery upon mystery.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Apple TV+ production: the silo rendered with claustrophobic detail, the outside through the viewport, the stairs connecting everything. The style is oppressive—the silo is character.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the silo: the staircase, the levels, the outside viewed through the lens. The production builds a world underground.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Who controls the silo? Why are they there? What happened outside? The show explores secrecy, authority, whether knowledge is dangerous. The mystery is everything.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Why are they in the silo? Each episode reveals more. The structure is mystery—revelation upon revelation. The drive is the truth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>Ongoing. Season 1 reveals some truth; more seasons planned. The mystery continues. Adaptation in progress.</p></div></section>
