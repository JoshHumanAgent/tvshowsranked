            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Morgan is a single mom with high potential—she's a genius, but her life is chaos. She works as a cleaner at the police station. When she rearranges evidence during a cleaning shift and solves a case, she's hired as a consultant. Kaitlin Olson stars in the adaptation of the French series HPI: the chaotic genius who sees what others miss.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Kaitlin Olson is Morgan: chaotic, brilliant, struggling to hold her life together while solving crimes. The contrast from It's Always Sunny shows range. The supporting cast provides the procedural framework. Olson carries the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The Los Angeles police station, Morgan's chaotic home, the cases of the week. The world is functional—procedural setting with a genius consultant overlay. The genius tropes are familiar.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Network procedural aesthetics: bright, functional, designed for syndication. The style is invisible—this is comfort television with a charismatic lead. The cases are staged clearly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is procedural crime-solving: evidence, deduction, case closed. The "spectacle" is watching Morgan's chaotic mind work. Comfort television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Genius vs. normal, whether potential equals success, the chaos of exceptional minds. The themes are present but secondary to the procedural. Light drama with character work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Case of the week with serialized character development: Morgan's parenting, her romantic life, her career. The structure is procedural reliable—each case resolves, the character grows.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Season 1 airing. The procedural formula is established; the character arcs are developing. Too early to assess conclusion.</p>
