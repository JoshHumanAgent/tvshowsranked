            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Teenage Elizabeth Tudor navigates the dangerous years after her father Henry VIII's death. Everyone wants to marry her—or kill her. Thomas Seymour, Catherine Parr, her brother Edward, her sister Mary. Alicia von Rittberg is Elizabeth: the princess becoming the queen. The making of Gloriana.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Alicia von Rittberg as young Elizabeth: intelligent, vulnerable, learning survival. Tom Cullen as Thomas Seymour: charming, dangerous, inappropriate. The supporting cast creates the Tudor court after Henry VIII. The performances capture the danger.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Post-Henry Tudor England: Edward VI's reign, the Seymour brothers' power struggle, Catholic vs. Protestant tension. The world is a court where orphaned princesses are pawns. The detail is historical and atmospheric.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz production: Tudor England in transition, the court intimate and dangerous. The style matches other Starz historical dramas—period detail, character focus.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the court, the ceremonies, the politics. This is political survival—not battles but marriages and executions. Intimate historical drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Female agency in a world that denies it, learning to survive, the making of queens, religious tension, family as danger. The show explores how Elizabeth became Elizabeth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Elizabeth must survive Edward's reign, navigate the Seymours, survive Mary's reign. The structure is survival thriller—orphans in a dangerous world. The drive is Elizabeth's ambition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after one season. The story covers Elizabeth's teenage years but doesn't reach her coronation. The ending is historical—her future is known—but the show didn't get to complete the journey. Incomplete.</p>
