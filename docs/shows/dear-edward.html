            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Dear Edward takes an almost unwatchable premise and makes it watchable through restraint. A plane crashes, killing everyone aboard except a twelve-year-old boy. The series follows that boy and the families of the other passengers as they navigate impossible grief. It's based on a novel, and the adaptation understands that the material requires emotional precision rather than manipulation.</p>

            <p>Colin O'Brien plays Edward, the survivor, and his performance captures something that feels true about traumatic survival: the guilt, the pressure to be okay, the way people project their needs onto someone who just happened to live. The series alternates between Edward's story and those of the family members left behind, creating a tapestry of grief that covers different kinds of loss: spouses, parents, siblings, a woman who was leaving her husband.</p>

            <p>Where Dear Edward struggles is in its density. There are too many storylines for ten episodes, and the need to check in with each grieving family means each thread gets limited development. Some subplots feel necessary; others feel like novel adaptations that didn't make the transition to visual form. But the central story—Edward trying to survive survival—is handled with care, and the show earns its emotional moments without relying on soundtrack cues or excessive crying. It's grief television that respects its subject, even when it can't dramatize every thread effectively.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Dear Edward earns its ranking through emotional honesty and a committed central performance. The score reflects a show that handles impossible material with care, even when its ambition exceeds its runtime.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Colin O'Brien as Edward carries the show with a performance that communicates overwhelming pressure without melodramatic acting. The adult cast creates distinct grieving styles, though the ensemble size limits individual development. The performances are respectful of the material without being subdued.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The series creates a sense of community among the bereaved, who find themselves connected by the same tragedy. The memorial services, the support groups, the particular rituals that emerge around mass death are rendered with attention to what grief actually looks like.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach is understated—handheld cameras in close spaces, natural light, an observational style that doesn't call attention to itself. The direction serves the actors rather than overwhelming them with technique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>There is no spectacle; the crash is not shown, the grief is interior. The show's visual interest is in faces and reactions, in the spaces where people wait for feelings they can't process. This is appropriate to the material but limits visual engagement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The series engages seriously with survivor's guilt, complicated grief, and the way tragedy creates community among strangers. Edward's status as sole survivor is treated as a burden rather than a miracle. The show resists easy redemption narratives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief television moves slowly by nature, and the multiple storylines require patience. Edward's story provides momentum, but the checks on other grieving families slow the pace. The structure serves the theme—grief isn't linear—but tests viewer attention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending provides emotional closure without easy resolution. Edward doesn't heal in any simple sense, and the other stories reach stopping points rather than conclusions. The show understands that some griefs don't resolve; they become part of the fabric of ongoing life.</p>
