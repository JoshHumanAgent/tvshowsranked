            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Professor Jasper Tempest is a brilliant criminology professor at Cambridge. He consults for the police. He's also obsessive-compulsive, germaphobic, and socially difficult. Ben Miller is Professor T in the English remake of the Belgian series: Monk meets academia, with an English accent.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ben Miller as Professor T: the brilliant but difficult consultant. The police team provides the cases and the friction. The performances are procedural solid—Miller is charming despite the character's difficulties.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Cambridge University and the police: the academia, the crime scenes, the professor's routines. The world serves the procedural—distinctive mainly for the Cambridge setting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>ITV production: Cambridge photographed nicely, the crime scenes procedural-standard. The style is functional—this is comfort crime TV.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is procedural crime: cases, deductions, resolutions. The "spectacle" is Professor T's eccentricities and insights. Classic detective TV.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Brilliance and difficulty, the cost of genius, whether we accept people as they are. The themes are present in the character; the procedural is the focus. Light exploration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Case of the week with serialized character development: Professor T's therapy, his relationship with the police. The structure is reliable procedural—each case solves, the character grows.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Three seasons completed. The procedural formula continues; the character arc progresses slowly. No endpoint announced.</p>
