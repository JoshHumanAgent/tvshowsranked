## What It Feels Like to Watch

Pluribus is a political thriller that gets inside the machinery of American politics. When a senator is handed a laptop containing evidence of a global conspiracy, he must decide what he's willing to sacrifice for truth.

You watch Pluribus and feel the weight of power. The series explores how difficult it is to do the right thing when the system is rigged against you. The conspirators are smart, connected, and ruthless.

The limited series format works well—six episodes that move efficiently from setup to climax. It's a contained story with big ideas about democracy, corruption, and individual agency.
