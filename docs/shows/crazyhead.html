            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Amy thinks she's having psychotic episodes. Actually, she's seeing demons. Raquel shows up and explains: they're demon hunters. The two young women become partners in exorcising demons from their British town. Cara Theobold and Susan Wokoma star in Howard Overman's horror-comedy: Buffy meets Misfits with British sensibility.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Cara Theobold as Amy: the reluctant hunter learning she's not crazy. Susan Wokoma as Raquel: the experienced demon hunter with her own issues. Their chemistry drives the show. The performances balance horror and comedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>British suburban demon hunting: the possessed, the rituals, the hierarchy waiting to emerge. The world is small-scale but functional—demons in the margins of ordinary life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>E4 production: British comedy-horror aesthetics, the demons rendered with TV budget, the suburbs as setting. The style is functional—the comedy and horror carry it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Demon possession, exorcisms, the creature effects. The spectacle is TV-budget horror—the ideas carry what budget can't show. Comedy-horror doesn't need spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Mental health as metaphor, female friendship, the supernatural as explanation for the unexplainable. The show treats demon hunting as therapy. The themes are present amid the jokes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Demon of the week with serialized mystery: what's the hierarchy, why Amy, can they stop the apocalypse? The structure is Buffy-esque—episodic cases building to bigger threat.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>One season (6 episodes). The story continues in implied future seasons that never came. The potential was there; the continuation wasn't. Cult favorite, incomplete.</p>
