            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Matilda's mother commits suicide. She discovers her mother was involved in a child's disappearance in Wales years ago. She travels to the village to investigate. Something is wrong there—something supernatural. Lydia Wilson is Matilda in the BBC's Welsh haunting: grief as mystery, the past refusing to stay buried.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Lydia Wilson as Matilda: the cellist drawn into her mother's secrets. Joel Fry as Hal: the childhood friend. The Welsh village provides the suspects. The performances are BBC horror-quiet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Welsh village: isolated, suspicious, hiding something. The haunted house on the hill, the community that doesn't welcome outsiders. The world is classic folk horror with Welsh specificity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC Wales production: the village photographed grey and ominous, the supernatural suggested rather than shown. The style is atmospheric—Folk horror aesthetics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the haunting: possessions, visions, the house. The supernatural is deployed sparingly—the atmosphere is the real show. British horror restraint.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, family secrets, what we inherit, the past as haunting. The show explores whether the supernatural is real or psychological. Folk horror themes with Welsh setting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>What happened to the missing child? What is Matilda's mother's connection? The structure is mystery with supernatural suggestion. Each episode reveals more of the past.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The mystery resolves, but the ending divides viewers—some find it satisfying, others frustratingly ambiguous. The supernatural element is confirmed but not explained.</p>
