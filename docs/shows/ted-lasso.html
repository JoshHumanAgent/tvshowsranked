<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">An American football coach is hired to manage a British football club. He knows nothing about soccer. Ted Lasso is kind in a cruel world. Jason Sudeikis created the anti-cynicism football comedy: winning matters less than being good people.</p>

<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Jason Sudeikis as Ted: unrelenting kindness. Hannah Waddingham as Rebecca: the boss with a heart. Brett Goldstein as Roy Kent. Phil Dunster as Jamie Tartt. Juno Temple as Keeley. Ensemble perfection.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>AFC Richmond: the locker room, the pitch, the pub, the British football culture. The world is warmth in a cynical sport.</p></div>

<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>Football matches, the pitch. The spectacle is emotional—goals that matter because characters care.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Kindness as strength, mental health, found family, redemption, winning vs. character. The show explores these with genuine warmth.</p></div>
