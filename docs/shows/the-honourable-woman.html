            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Nessa Stein inherits her father's arms business and tries to redirect it toward Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation. Three phones ring in the night; a lawyer falls from a balcony; a child is kidnapped; everyone has angles within angles. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the honourable woman whose honour is tested by everyone: MI6, the CIA, Mossad, Palestinian militants, Israeli hardliners. Hugo Blick creates a thriller where every side is compromised and the only innocent people are the ones who don't matter to anyone.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Maggie Gyllenhaal's Nessa is extraordinary: controlled, damaged, the weight of inheritance visible in every gesture. Andrew Buchan as her brother, Stephen Rea as the MI6 officer, Janet McTeer as the manipulator—the ensemble is uniformly superb. Every performance has depth; every character has secrets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict rendered as le Carré thriller: the business interests, the intelligence services, the political calculations, the ordinary people caught between. The world is cynical and accurate—institutions serve themselves, peace is leverage, innocence is liability. Educational without lecturing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>London, Israel, Palestine—each location photographed with appropriate tone. The style is sophisticated thriller: shadows, close-ups, the weight of implication. The visual language communicates power dynamics without dialogue. Prestige TV filmmaking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle—this is people in rooms making decisions that kill people elsewhere. The spectacle is power exercised invisibly: phone calls, meetings, files on desks. The tension is in what's not shown, only implied.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The Middle East as mirror for Western hypocrisy. The show explores how good intentions are weaponized, how peace becomes business, how children are currency. Nessa is the honourable woman in an honourless system. The themes are sophisticated, the execution is precise. Political thriller as moral philosophy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight episodes of web-weaving: who killed the lawyer? Who took the child? What does everyone want? The answers require attention; the show doesn't simplify. The pacing is deliberate—complexity accrues rather than accelerates. Demands engagement; rewards it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries. The conspiracy is revealed; the cost is tallied; the honourable woman survives but cannot be what she intended. The ending is honest about compromise—no one is innocent, innocence is meaningless. Resolution without redemption.</p>
