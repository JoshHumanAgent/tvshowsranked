            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Stede Bonnet was a gentleman who became a pirate. He was terrible at it. Then he met Blackbeard. Rhys Darby is Stede; Taika Waititi is Blackbeard. David Jenkins created the pirate workplace comedy: tenderness and violence on the high seas, romance between killers.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Rhys Darby as Stede: the gentleman pirate, gentle in all the wrong ways. Taika Waititi as Blackbeard: the legend discovering something new. The crew creates the workplace comedy ensemble. The performances balance absurdity with genuine feeling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>18th-century piracy as workplace: the Revenge, pirate society, the constraints of reputation. The world is historical comedy—the pirate world rendered as office dynamics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Max production: ships, seas, period costumes rendered with comedy sensibility. The style is bright—piracy as adventure, not grim reality. The aesthetic serves the tone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is pirate comedy: raids gone wrong, naval battles rendered absurd, the Revenge's odd crew. The production supports the comedy. Not epic, but charming.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Masculinity, tenderness in violent worlds, toxic vs. healthy relationships, found family, queerness in history. The show explores these through comedy that deepens into romance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Stede's journey from terrible pirate to something more, his relationship with Blackbeard, the crew's dynamics. The structure is romantic comedy with pirate stakes. The drive is relationship.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled. The relationship between Stede and Blackbeard developed beautifully but won't complete. The cancellation denied the full arc. The journey is excellent; the destination is incomplete.</p>
