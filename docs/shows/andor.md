## What It Feels Like to Watch

Andor isn't like other Star Wars stories. It's not about Jedi or lightsabers or the Force. It's about rebellion—the boring, difficult, unglamorous work of taking down an empire.

You meet Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) five years before Rogue One. He's a thief, a loner, someone who's given up on hope. But circumstances conspire to drag him into the fight against the Empire, and you watch as cynicism transforms into purpose.

The first three episodes work as a standalone film—Cassian's origin story, showing his world on the corporate-controlled planet Morlana One. It's gritty, realistic, and grounded. Then the show expands, introducing the rebel network, the Imperial occupation, and the small victories and terrible losses that define resistance.

Diego Luna is phenomenal. He makes Cassian's journey feel earned. You see his anger, his grief, his gradual opening to hope. The supporting cast is equally strong—particularly Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma and Stellan Skarsgård as Luthen Rael.

What makes Andor special is its willingness to take risks. It explores the moral complexity of rebellion. It shows the Empire not as cartoon villains but as a system that normal people participate in, often without thinking. It asks hard questions about what we're willing to sacrifice for freedom.

The production is gorgeous. The showrunner Tony Gilroy brings his Michael Clayton sensibilities to a galaxy far, far away. Every frame is composed. Every scene has purpose.

Andor is proof that Star Wars can tell mature stories. It's the anti-prequel—instead of explaining origins, it looks forward to consequences. We know how this story ends. But watching Cassian find his way there is unforgettable.
