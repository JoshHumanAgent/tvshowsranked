## What It Feels Like to Watch

East Highland High School. A group of teenagers navigate love, loss, sexuality, addiction, and identity. This is *Euphoria* — HBO's prestige teen drama that pulls no punches.

Created by Sam Levinson (son of Barbara), the show is visually stunning: each episode looks like a music video, with bold colors, inventive camera work, and a soundtrack that spans genres. It's the most aesthetically distinctive teen drama ever made.

But looks are just the surface. *Euphoria* is unflinching about the experiences of its characters: Rue (Zendaya), a drug addict in recovery, narrates the story; Jules (Hunter Schafer), a trans girl looking for love; Nate (Jacob Elordi), a closeted homophobe with anger issues; Cassie (Maude Apatow), who keeps making terrible choices about men.

The show is controversial. Some argue it romanticizes drug use and dangerous behavior. Others argue it's a realistic depiction of modern adolescence. The truth is probably somewhere in between — it's certainly not a cautionary tale, but it's also not encouraging these behaviors.

Zendaya won an Emmy for her performance as Rue — and it's well-deserved. She's extraordinary, bringing vulnerability, humor, and devastation to a character who's easy to root for and hard to watch.
