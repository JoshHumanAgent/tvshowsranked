<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Philip and Elizabeth Jennings are Soviet spies posing as American travel agents in 1980s Washington DC. Their neighbor is an FBI counterintelligence agent. They have children who don't know who their parents really are. Joe Weisberg created the spy thriller as marriage drama: the Cold War as domestic tension.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Matthew Rhys as Philip: the spy who begins to love America. Keri Russell as Elizabeth: the believer. Noah Emmerich as Stan Beeman: the FBI agent next door. The performances make the marriage the show's center. The spy work is secondary to the relationship.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>1980s America: Reagan's America, the Cold War, the surveillance, the paranoia. The world is the marriage as microcosm—two ideologies sharing a bed. The period detail is perfect.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>FX production: the 1980s rendered with period precision, the spy work staged for tension, the domestic scenes for intimacy. The style serves the duality—home is cover.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is spy work: disguises, surveillance, the occasional violence. The real spectacle is the marriage—watching two people pretend to love, then actually love, then fall apart.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Loyalty: to country, to spouse, to ideology, to self. The show explores what happens when these loyalties conflict. Marriage as political alliance, love as ideology, whether we can ever truly know each other.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Philip softens toward America; Elizabeth hardens. The center is the marriage—will it survive the espionage? Each season escalates the tension. The drive is domestic as much as spy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Six seasons with perfect ending. The finale is among television's best—the garage scene, the drive, the separation. The ending completes the show's thesis. Essential.</p></div></section>
