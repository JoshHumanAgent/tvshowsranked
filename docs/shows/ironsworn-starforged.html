            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Ironsworn: Starforged takes the oathbound fantasy of its predecessor and launches it into space, creating a science fiction series where the iron promises of the original become cosmic bonds as vast as the void itself. Space is the final frontier, but in this universe, frontiers are lawless places where survival requires oaths sworn to factions, creeds, and desperate causes that transcend planetary boundaries. The show understands that space opera works when it remembers the human element in the vastness.</p>

            <p>The leap to science fiction expands the possibilities while maintaining the core tension: when you swear to something across the light-years, what happens when circumstances pull you in conflicting directions? Space stations, drifting colony ships, and frontier settlements become the new Ironlands, each with their own codes and consequences. The visual approach distinguishes alien worlds without making them feel like sets—space is hostile, and the technology shows wear.</p>

            <p>Where Starforged struggles is the shadow of its predecessor. Space setting requires different storytelling rhythms than northern wilderness, and the six-episode format feels even more constricted for world-building across planets. The oath mechanics translate but lose some immediate impact when mediated by space travel times and cosmic scale. The show works best grounding vast concepts in intimate stakes—one person's promise matters more than galactic politics. Production values exceed the original, but the soul feels similar: a universe where what you promise defines you more than what you can do.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Starforged earns its position through ambition and visual upgrade, held back by the difficulty of translating intimate oath mechanics to cosmic scale. The score reflects a sequel that reaches for something grander than its predecessor but sometimes loses grip.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (6/10)</h3e>
                Similar limitations to the original: six episodes mean sketches rather than portraits. The space setting allows for more visual distinction but less psychological depth. The performances are professional without providing the standout work that would elevate the material.
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3e>
                The science fiction expansion works—the factions, the technology level, the frontier feel of space stations desperate for resources. The show creates a lived-in universe with history and politics visible in design details. The oathbound culture translates across settings effectively.

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3e>
                Space allows for visual grandeur—nebulae, planetary surfaces, claustrophobic ship interiors. The effects budget has increased, and it shows in the scale of world-building. The grounded aesthetic continues but with cosmic scope.
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3e>
                The space setting naturally provides spectacle: space stations, zero-g sequences, alien landscapes. The show delivers on science fiction visuals without excessive CGI sheen. Practical effects enhance the lived-in quality.
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6.5/10)</h3e>
                The oath system continues to generate interesting tensions about obligation across distance. The cosmic setting allows for larger-scale implications—what happens when your oath conflicts with planetary survival? But the six episodes don't fully explore these extensions.
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3e>
                Space travel times create natural breaks that sometimes disrupt momentum. The oath structure still provides forward motion, but the cosmic scale makes some developments feel delayed rather than immediate. Six episodes feel abbreviated for the world established.
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3e>
                The ending provides resolution to immediate plots while opening larger possibilities. The cosmic setting suggests stories beyond what the season delivers. Viewers may feel they're getting a prologue rather than a complete season.
