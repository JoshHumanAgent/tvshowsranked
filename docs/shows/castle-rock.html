            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Castle Rock is a Stephen King universe anthology that stitches together characters, locations, and mythology from across his work into original stories set in the haunted Maine town that appears in so many of his novels. The show doesn't adapt specific books; it remixes the ingredients—Shawshank Prison, the Marsten House, characters named Castle and Torrance—into something that feels like King without being King exactly.</p>

            <p>The first season follows a death-row attorney who returns to Castle Rock when a mysterious man is found in an abandoned block of Shawshank, and the second season explores the origins of Annie Wilkes from Misery. Bill Skarsgård plays the found man with an unsettling stillness that echoes his Pennywise without repeating it; Lizzy Caplan makes Annie Wilkes newly terrifying while honoring Kathy Bates's original. The show works best when it creates atmosphere rather than explaining it—the long shots of Maine landscapes, the gradual sense that something is deeply wrong.</p>

            <p>Where Castle Rock struggles is in resolution. The first season's ending divides viewers—some finding it satisfyingly strange, others finding it incomprehensible. The second season is more conventional but less ambitious. The show's strengths are in its production design, its performances, and its willingness to be genuinely creepy. Its weaknesses are in needing King's world more than King himself needs explanation. Fans of the author will enjoy spotting references; viewers unfamiliar with the source material may find the mythology confusing.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Castle Rock earns its position through atmosphere, performance, and a genuine understanding of what makes Stephen King's work unsettling. The score reflects a show that succeeds more as mood than narrative.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Bill Skarsgård's performance in season one is genuinely unsettling—a physical presence that communicates threat through stillness. Lizzy Caplan's Annie Wilkes in season two captures the character's particular instability. The supporting casts create a population of damaged people that King's worlds require. The performances elevate material that could feel derivative.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Castle Rock itself becomes a character—a small town with accumulated horror, where tragedy isn't anomaly but pattern. The show connects King's universe without requiring knowledge of specific books. Shawshank looms over the town physically and thematically. The production design creates a place where bad things happening feels inevitable rather than surprising.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach emphasizes atmosphere—long takes, empty spaces, the particular quality of New England light. The show looks like King's world should: ordinary places where the ordinary has gone wrong. The Shawshank sequences are particularly effective in creating dread through architecture.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The horror is atmospheric rather than effects-driven. There are moments of violence, but the show's scares come from what you almost see and what you fear is there. The spectacle is psychological—unreliable narration, characters who might not be what they seem—rather than visual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages with King's recurring themes: the weight of the past, the evil that accumulates in places, the way trauma echoes through generations. The mythology is more tribute than original, but the themes are handled with understanding of what makes them powerful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Both seasons build momentum through mystery—who is this man, what does Annie want—but the resolution in each case requires accepting ambiguity or contrivance. The journey is more satisfying than the destination, which is perhaps appropriate for King's world but frustrates viewers seeking clean answers.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season's finale is divisive; the second season becomes more conventional but perhaps less interesting. The show doesn't stick its landings in ways that match its atmosphere. Horror fans may appreciate the ambiguity; narrative-focused viewers may find it frustrating.</p>
