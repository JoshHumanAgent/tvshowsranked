            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Ian Grimm is the creative director of Mythic Quest, the world's biggest MMORPG. He's a genius visionary and a terrible boss. Poppy Li is his lead engineer, brilliant in her own right, struggling under his ego. The team includes a toxic head of monetization, a clueless community manager, and a receptionist who's smarter than everyone. Rob McElhenney (It's Always Sunny) created a workplace comedy that evolved into TV's surprisingly thoughtful exploration of creativity, collaboration, and what art costs.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Rob McElhenney as Ian is comic brilliance: the ego, the insecurity, the flashes of vision. Charlotte Nicdao as Poppy is the show's heart—brilliant, frustrated, learning to lead. David Hornsby, Danny Pudi, Jessie Ennis, Ashly Burch—the ensemble is perfectly calibrated. The best workplace comedy cast since The Office.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Game development studio: the offices, the development process, the toxic players, the corporate overlords. Ubisoft consulted on authenticity. The world is specific—you learn how games are made, how studios function, how creativity and capitalism conflict.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ production: clean, modern, functional. The game itself is visible in places; the office life is photographed with comedic clarity. The direction serves the jokes and the performances without distinguishing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is occasional game footage or convention scenes. This is people in offices talking, arguing, collaborating. The "spectacle" is comedy—set pieces, confrontations, escalating absurdity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Creativity vs. profit, art vs. collaboration, ego vs. team, what we sacrifice for our work. The show explores these seriously beneath the comedy. The quarantine episode ("Everlight") and the standalone episodes ("A Dark Quiet Death") add depth. Surprisingly philosophical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a game to launch: an expansion, a sequel, a movie deal. The drive is project-based, like game development itself. Ian and Poppy's relationship provides the serialized tension—can they work together? The pacing is comedy-fast; the stakes develop underneath.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues to develop Ian and Poppy's relationship and the studio's evolution. No clear endpoint; the workplace comedy model allows indefinite continuation. Currently delivering quality without defined conclusion.</p>
