            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Lin Ford escapes from an Australian prison and flees to Bombay. He disappears into the city's underworld, becomes a doctor in the slums, falls in love, and runs afoul of criminals. Charlie Hunnam is Lin in the adaptation of Gregory David Roberts' novel. Bombay in the 1980s: the slums, the gangs, the chaos, the humanity.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Charlie Hunnam as Lin: the escaped convict seeking redemption. The ensemble (Antonia Desplat, Alexander Siddig, David Fields) creates Bombay's expatriate and local worlds. The performances are committed, though Hunnam's accent varies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1980s Bombay: the slums, the underworld, the expatriate community, the bureaucracy. The city is a character—photographed with love and grit. The world is immersive and specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ production: Bombay photographed in all its chaos and beauty. The slums, the streets, the architecture. The style immerses you in the city—the colors, the crowds, the life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is Bombay: the slums, the festivals, the underworld operations. This is adventure in the classic sense—escape, survival, reinvention. The city provides the spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Redemption, whether we can escape our pasts, belonging, the meaning of home. The show explores Lin's journey from prisoner to slum doctor to wanted man. The themes are present in the adventure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Lin must survive Bombay, avoid capture, help in the slums, and navigate the underworld. The drive is survival—each episode brings new danger. The pacing is deliberate, sometimes slow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after one season. The novel continues; the show doesn't. The adaptation is incomplete—Lin's story is half-told. The production was expensive; the viewership wasn't sufficient.</p>
