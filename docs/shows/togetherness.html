            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Brett and Michelle are married with two kids. Their sex life is dead. Alex is Brett's best friend, an actor who can't catch a break. Tina is Michelle's sister, looking for purpose. Four people in Los Angeles trying to figure out adulthood. Mark and Jay Duplass created the dramedy: uncomfortable, honest, real.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Mark Duplass as Brett, Melanie Lynskey as Michelle, Steve Zissis as Alex, Amanda Peet as Tina. The four create characters who feel like real people—flawed, struggling, lovable. The performances are naturalistic in the best way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Los Angeles adulthood: the houses, the jobs, the friendships, the disappointments. The world is specific to people who haven't figured it out. LA without glamour.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO mumblecore: handheld, natural light, the intimacy of close quarters. The style is invisible—this is about character, not visual flourish. The Duplass aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people in houses: marriages, friendships, disappointments. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching people be honest about unhappiness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Marriage, friendship, the difficulty of connection, whether we're meant to be with one person forever, what happens when dreams don't work out. The show explores these without easy answers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The relationships: Brett and Michelle's marriage, Alex's career, Tina's search. The drive is emotional—will they figure it out? The structure is character-driven comedy-drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled. The story was continuing when HBO ended it. The relationships were in progress; the ending wasn't an ending. Beloved but incomplete.</p>
