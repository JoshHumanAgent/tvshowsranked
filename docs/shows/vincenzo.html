            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Vincenzo Cassano is a Korean-Italian mafia consigliere who returns to Korea when his boss dies and the new boss wants him dead. He goes to the building where his mother hid gold—and finds it occupied by tenants who refuse to leave. He becomes their unlikely protector, fighting a corrupt corporation with mafia methods. Song Joong-ki is Vincenzo: stylish, ruthless, secretly soft. K-drama meets gangster epic, with olive oil and arson.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Song Joong-ki creates an iconic character: theItalian suits, the cold stare, the occasional warmth. Jeon Yeo-been as Hong Cha-young provides the romantic tension and legal chaos. Ok Taec-yeon as the villain's son adds complexity. The ensemble of tenants provides comedy and heart.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Seoul corporate world: the Babel Group, the law firms, the media empire. The Geumga Plaza building is specific—each tenant has a business and personality. The world is Korean capitalism rendered as battleground: corporations destroy, the little people resist, Vincenzo protects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama production at high budget: the suits are sharp, the sets are expensive, the action is staged with flair. Italy is rendered in sweeping shots; Korea is rendered corporate and residential. The visual style matches the tone—crime film aesthetics applied to television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is style: Vincenzo's suits, his methods, the olive oil, the arson, the takedowns. The action sequences are staged with panache. The show is visual candy—fashion, interiors, cityscapes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Corporate corruption, the law vs. justice, whether violence can be righteous, found family. The themes are present but secondary to style and plot. The show is entertainment first; the morality is flexible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode has a target: a corrupt executive, a legal battle, a piece of gold to recover. The serialized plot is Vincenzo vs. Babel Group. The pacing is relentless—this is 20 episodes of momentum. K-drama structure at its most bingeable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete in 20 episodes. The gold is found, the villains are destroyed, Vincenzo returns to Italy. The ending is satisfying—revenge achieved, justice served, style intact. K-drama structure with proper resolution.</p>
