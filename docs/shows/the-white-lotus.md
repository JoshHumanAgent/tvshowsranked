## What It Feels Like to Watch

The White Lotus is a perfectly crafted social satire that holds a mirror to the wealthy and watches them squirm. Each season brings a new group of guests to a luxury resort, and what unfolds is darkly comedic examination of class, power, and privilege.

You watch The White Lotus and can't look away from the train wreck. The characters are awful—selfish, entitled, deluded—but also strangely human. Mike White has a gift for writing people who are frustratingly real.

The production is gorgeous. Hawaiian resorts have never looked so beautiful or so sinister. The score is memorable. Every frame is composed for maximum impact.

But beneath the satire lies something deeper. The show asks uncomfortable questions about wealth, death, and what we really want from life. The comedy masks genuine tragedy.
