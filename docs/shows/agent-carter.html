            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1946. Peggy Carter works for the SSR—the precursor to SHIELD—ignored by her male colleagues. She takes on secret missions on her own. Hayley Atwell reprises her Captain America role: feminist spy thriller, period piece, Marvel universe. The show that provedMarvel could do television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter: capable, frustrated, brilliant. James D'Arcy as Edwin Jarvis provides the support. The supporting cast creates post-war America. Atwell carries with authority.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Post-war America: the SSR office, the Howard Stark technology, the emerging Hydra threat. The world connects to Captain America while standing alone. The 1940s are rendered with style.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>ABC Marvel production: 1940s rendered with style, the spy action staged with period flair. The aesthetic is retro-Modern—the look of post-war with comic book energy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Spies, gadgets, fights, villainy. The spectacle is TV-budget Marvel—enough to sell the universe, constrained compared to films. The period style compensates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Sexism in post-war America, women's work erased while men take credit, competence vs. perception. The show explores 1940s gender dynamics without preaching. Feminist superhero.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a mission: clearing Howard Stark's name, stopping Zero Matter. The structure is spy thriller—mission, investigation, resolution. The drive is Peggy proving herself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled. Peggy's story continues in films and other shows, but Agent Carter ended before its time. The cancellation was controversial. Incomplete.</p>
