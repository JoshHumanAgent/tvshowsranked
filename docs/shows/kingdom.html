            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Joseon Dynasty Korea. The king is dead; plague is spreading; the dead are rising. Crown Prince Chang must navigate political conspiracy while fighting a zombie outbreak. This is historical drama meets zombie horror: period costumes, court intrigue, and hordes of the undead. Korean zombie production at its finest—the action is ferocious, the politics are Shakespearean, the scope is epic.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ju Ji-hoon as the Crown Prince is heroic and complex—a man learning leadership in crisis. Bae Doona as the physician's assistant provides scientific counterpoint to political machinations. Kim Sung-kyu as the servant-turned-survivor provides comic relief and heart. The performances are committed; the zombies are terrifying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Joseon Korea rendered in detail: the palaces, the villages, the class hierarchies, the medical practices. The zombie outbreak is integrated into this world—the plague spreads, the dead rise, the politics continue. Historical accuracy meets horror invention seamlessly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Period drama production values with horror staging: the palaces are sumptuous, the zombie attacks are chaotic and clear. The action sequences are staged for scale—hundreds of zombies in period dress. The cinematography serves both genres beautifully.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the zombie hordes: masses of undead in Joseon clothing, attacking villages, overrunning armies. The action is visceral, the gore is present, the scale is impressive. This is zombie spectacle on historical drama budget.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Political corruption, the cost of power, the failure of authority in crisis. The show explores how conspiracy continues even during plague—politics doesn't stop for zombies. The themes are present but secondary to action and intrigue.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Six episodes per season, each building toward the next crisis. The political conspiracy unfolds while the zombie threat escalates. The pacing is propulsive—the plague spreads, the prince runs, the dead multiply. Action and political intrigue in perfect balance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons with open ending. The second season concludes the immediate crisis but sets up larger scope (expansion into China). A prequel special exists; a third season is requested but unconfirmed. Incomplete but satisfying as story so far.</p>
