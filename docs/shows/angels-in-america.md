## What It Feels Like to Watch

Angels in America is not just television—it is an event. A landmark piece of storytelling that redefined what the medium could accomplish. You are watching history being made, and you feel every minute of its 68-minute episodes.

The experience is overwhelming in the best possible way. It opens in 1985 New York City, in the early days of the AIDS crisis, and follows a large ensemble of characters whose lives intersect, collide, and transform. There is Prior Walter, a young man whose boyfriend is dying of AIDS; Louis Ironson, the boyfriend who abandons him; Roy Cohn, a notorious real-life lawyer and fixer who is himself dying; and a multitude of others whose stories weave together in ways both realistic and fantastical.

What sets Angels in America apart is its fearless embrace of theatricality. The script, adapted by Tony Kushner from his own play, does not try to be cinematically naturalistic. Characters break the fourth wall. A giant angel crashes through the ceiling. Prior Walter has conversations with ghosts. This should not work—and yet it does, spectacularly.

The performances are simply extraordinary. Al Pacino disappears into Roy Cohn, capturing the man's monstrousness without caricature. Meryl Streep plays multiple roles, each distinct and powerful. Emma Thompson, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeffrey Wright—the entire cast operates at a level that redefined television acting.

But beyond the spectacle, what you remember is the emotional truth. This is a show about love and loss, about what it means to be American, about the bonds that hold us together and the ways we abandon each other. It asks big questions and does not pretend to have easy answers. By the end, you have been through something. You have witnessed something. And you will not think about television the same way again.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 10.0

**Raw Score: 10.0 | Weighted: 2.00**

**Strengths:**
- **Roy Cohn (Al Pacino)**: One of the greatest performances in television history. Pacino disappears into this real-life monster—a fixer who denies his own sexuality even as he dies of AIDS. His scenes with Belize (Jeffrey Wright) are masterpieces of tension.
- **Prior Walter (Justin Kirk)**: The emotional heart of the series. Kirk makes Prior's journey from abandonment to transcendence feel real and moving.
- **Harper Pitt (Mary-Louise Parker)**: The agoraphobic Mormon wife whose hallucinations become real. Parker's vulnerability is heartbreaking.
- **Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman)**: The boyfriend who abandons Prior. Shenkman makes his moral weakness compelling rather than simply contemptible.
- **The Angel (Emma Thompson)**: The physical embodiment of prophecy. Thompson's theatrical performance is unforgettable.
- **The ensemble**: Meryl Streep's multiple roles, Jeffrey Wright's dignity, Patrick Wilson's Joe—all extraordinary.

**Weaknesses:**
- None. This is arguably the greatest ensemble in television history.
