            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Derry, Maine, before the Losers' Club. Pennywise awakens, and the town's dark history bleeds into the present. Stephen King's universe expanded into series television: the cyclical horror that returns every 27 years, the adults who look away, the children who see everything. HBO production values applied to small-town nightmare. The prequel that justifies its existence by going deeper into Derry's rot.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>New characters in a familiar setting: the Creeds, the townspeople, the children marked by Pennywise's attention. The performances are solid; Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise looms even when absent. The child actors carry fear convincingly. Too early for definitive judgment; the foundation is strong.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Derry as King created it: a town that keeps secrets, where children disappear and adults forget. The show expands the mythology—the town's founding, the previous cycles, the families connected to the horror. The world is consistent with King's novel while adding depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO horror production: atmospheric, deliberate, willing to linger on dread. The period setting (prequel era) is rendered with care. The visual style matches the films—dark basements, storm drains, the red balloon as signal. Competent horror filmmaking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is Pennywise and the town's horrors: manifestations, transformations, the sewer world. The budget shows—this is feature-quality horror on television. The scares are staged with confidence. Horror spectacle executed well.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>King's themes: the evil that hides in small towns, the complicity of adults, the power of childhood friendship against darkness. The show explores these without adding substantially to King's vision. The conceptual strength is inherited; execution is the question.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Too early to judge fully. The prequel structure provides known endpoint—this leads toward the IT films. The drive is discovery: how did Derry become what it is? The opening episodes establish tension effectively. Potential for excellence; needs time to prove.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show must navigate between King's novel, the film adaptations, and its own story. Whether it achieves satisfying resolution while serving as prequel remains to be seen. Premise is strong; trajectory uncertain.</p>
