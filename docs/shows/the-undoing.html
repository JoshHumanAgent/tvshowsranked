            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">The Undoing is a limited series about a wealthy Manhattan family whose life unravels when the husband is accused of murder. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Fraser, a therapist whose comfortable upper-east-side existence is shattered when her oncologist husband Jonathan, played by Hugh Grant, becomes the prime suspect in a brutal killing. The show is adapted from Jean Hanff Korelitz's novel by David E. Kelley, whose previous Big Little Lies established this template: prestige cast, beautiful production, mystery structure, and themes about the secrets that wealth conceals.</p>

            <p>Hugh Grant's casting is the show's key decision. Known for charming rogues, Grant plays against type to reveal the creepier dimensions of his persona—the affability that can mask manipulation, the smile that might be covering something. Jonathan Fraser is not simply guilty or innocent; he's a man whose charm has allowed him to avoid consequences, and the series explores what happens when charm stops working. Kidman's Grace must decide whether she married a murderer or is watching an innocent man be destroyed.</p>

            <p>The series is structured as a whodunit with a court case, but its real interest is in the social dynamics of wealth. Grace's friends, her family, her therapist colleagues all have reactions to the accusation that reveal how class protection works in practice. The ending provides resolution—the mystery is solved—but the pleasure is in watching privileged people confront the possibility that their protections might not be absolute.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>The Undoing earns its ranking through Hugh Grant's against-type performance, Nicole Kidman's emotional center, and production values that make wealth look beautiful and empty. The score reflects a prestige mystery that delivers satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Hugh Grant's performance is the center—the charm that made him a star applied to a character whose charm is weaponized. Nicole Kidman provides emotional grounding as a woman whose life is deconstructed. The supporting cast, including Donald Sutherland and Lily Rabe, creates fully realized adults.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Manhattan's wealthy enclaves are rendered with attention to how money lives—apartments, schools, therapist offices where problems are discussed without being solved. The world is specific enough to create authentic detail without overwhelming the mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO's production values mean everything looks expensive. The direction serves the mystery without calling attention to itself. Court scenes are staged with clarity; domestic scenes reveal character through composition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is wealth—apartments, coats, lives that cost more than most people earn in years. There's no effects or action. The visual interest is in watching privileged people in trouble.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores how wealth protects, how charm disguises, how well we can know the people we marry. The themes are present but not profound. This is a mystery with social observation, not social observation disguised as mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The mystery structure provides inherent momentum—did he do it, will he be convicted, what will Grace decide? The limited series count means no padding; each episode advances toward resolution without detour.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending resolves the central question definitively while providing emotional closure for Grace. The truth emerges in ways that reframe what came before. The resolution satisfies both mystery and character arcs.</p>
