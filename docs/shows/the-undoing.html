<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Grace Fraser's husband is accused of murder. She thought she knew him. She didn't. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant star in David E. Kelley's adaptation of Jean Hanff Korelitz's novel: wealthy Manhattan unraveling, marriage as mystery.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Nicole Kidman as Grace: the wife whose certainty dissolves. Hugh Grant as Jonathan: the charming husband with secrets. Donald Sutherland as the father. The performances are prestige thriller.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Manhattan wealth: the apartments, the schools, the trust funds. The world is upper-class privilege—how it protects and how it fails.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>HBO production: Manhattan and the Hamptons photographed for wealth and doubt. Susanne Bier directed—the style is psychological thriller.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is wealth: the coats (so many coats), the apartments, the lifestyle. The "spectacle" is the trial and the doubt.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Marriage as mystery, whether we can know anyone, privilege as protection and blindness, what we sacrifice for appearance. The show explores these through the thriller.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Did he do it? Each episode reveals more doubts, more secrets. The structure is whodunit—perfect for binge-watching. The pacing is relentless.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The trial reveals the truth. The ending is satisfying though some found it predictable. Prestige thriller done well.</p></div></section>
