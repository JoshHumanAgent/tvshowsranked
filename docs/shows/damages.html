            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A mentor-destroyer relationship weaponized. Glenn Close is Patty Hewes—a lawyer whose brilliance is matched only by her ruthlessness. Rose Byrne is Ellen Parsons—the protégé who learns too well from her master. The timelines fold in on themselves: you see the end before the beginning, then watch the machinery of manipulation that got there. Each season is a closed loop, a psychological thriller dressed as legal drama.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Glenn Close as Patty Hewes is among television's great performances—sociopathic lawyer made comprehensible, even sympathetic, through sheer charisma. Rose Byrne matches her as Ellen, the innocent corrupted. Ted Danson, William Hurt, John Goodman, Lily Tomlin—the guest stars across seasons are embarrassingly strong. This is actor heaven, and everyone delivers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>New York law, corporate malfeasance, the machinations of plaintiff litigation. The show renders the legal world in specific detail—depositions, settlements, the economics of class action. But the world serves the characters rather than existing independently. This is character drama first, legal procedural second.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The non-linear structure requires visual clarity—past and future must be distinguishable instantly. The show achieves this through subtle cues: lighting changes, costuming. The style is functional rather than flashy. When violence occurs, it's shot for impact rather than style. Effective, not memorable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle here—this is people in offices, talking, manipulating, destroying each other legally and psychologically. The spectacle is the structural innovation: flash-forwards that recontextualize everything you've watched. The thrills are intellectual rather than visual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Mentor-student dynamics weaponized. The cost of ambition. The impossibility of justice in a system that rewards manipulation. Damages dramatizes corporate evil through individual corruption—Patty Hewes is what happens when talent meets amorality. The themes are sophisticated, delivered through structural innovation rather than explicit statement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The non-linear structure creates compulsion: you see the end, you need to know how you got there. Each season is a puzzle whose solution recontextualizes every scene. The mystery engine is powerful—episodes end with revelations that demand viewing the next. Strong narrative architecture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with varying quality. Season 1 is near-perfect; subsequent seasons reach but don't always match. The final season brings closure: Patty and Ellen's relationship resolves satisfactorily, though the cost is high. The show peaks early but holds quality throughout. A complete story, worth the investment.</p>
