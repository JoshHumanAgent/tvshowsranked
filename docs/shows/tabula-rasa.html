            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A woman with amnesia is the only witness to a disappearance—but she can't remember what she saw. She's committed to a psychiatric hospital; everyone around her seems to have secrets. The past bleeds into present, memory fragments into dream, nothing is reliable including her own mind. Belgian noir at its most intricate: a puzzle box where the puzzle keeps changing. The title means "blank slate"—and everything is up for rewriting.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Veerle Baetens as Mie, the amnesiac, navigates uncertainty with precision—we believe her confusion, share her fear. The supporting cast creates a web of suspicion: doctors, family, fellow patients. The performances are European in style: restrained, interior, cumulative. Not showy, but effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The psychiatric hospital as locked-room mystery: corridors, therapy sessions, the routines that create temporary stability. Beyond it, Belgium rendered as gray and uncertain—this isn't travel-poster Europe, it's the Europe of bureaucratic function. The world is contained, appropriate to the narrative's limitations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show uses visual language to communicate psychological state: focus shifts, color desaturation, dream sequences that bleed into reality. The style serves the content—Mie's experience shapes what we see. European art-film aesthetics applied to genre thriller.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is psychological drama: people in rooms, memories surfacing, identity being reconstructed. The spectacle is mental—not what we see, but what we're forced to question.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Memory and identity. If you can't remember your past, are you still yourself? The show explores pathological amnesia not as plot convenience but as existential condition. Themes of trauma, repression, the construction of self. The mystery is philosophical as much as procedural.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Nine episodes of mounting uncertainty. Each revelation complicates rather than resolves. The show maintains tension through information control—we know only what Mie knows, and Mie knows nothing for certain. The drive is compulsion to understand. Binge-ready.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries with satisfying resolution. The truth emerges, identity clarifies, the puzzle solution justifies the journey. The ending is earned—clues planted throughout pay off. European television demonstrating how to conclude mysteries properly.</p>
