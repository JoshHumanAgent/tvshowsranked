            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                2077: corporations have replaced government. Kiera Cameron is a Protector (corporate police) pursuing terrorists who escape through time to 2012. She follows them. Now she's trapped in our present, trying to stop the terrorists while trying to get home. Rachel Nichols is Kiera—determined, principled, increasingly aware that her "utopian" future might be dystopian. Canadian sci-fi that asks: what if the bad guys are right?
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Rachel Nichols makes Kiera compelling: the loyalty to corporate government that slowly becomes doubt. Victor Webster as detective Carlos provides the present-day partnership. Eric Knudsen as Alec (young tech genius whose older self created Kiera's future) adds complexity. The ensemble serves the concept.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>2077 is rendered in glimpses: corporate control, Protector technology, the surveillance state. 2012 is our world, complicated by time travelers. The time travel rules are developed across seasons—the future can change, paradoxes exist, consequences ripple. The world is thought through.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Canadian cable TV budget: Vancouver as present-day, sparse future renders, practical effects. The style is functional. The future tech (suits, weapons) is designed with care despite budget limits. The show looks like what it is: smart sci-fi without blockbuster resources.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the future technology: Kiera's suit, the weapons, the occasional future sequence. Budget limits the spectacle; imagination fills the gaps. This is ideas television, not effects television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Corporate vs. democratic governance, whether terrorism is justified when the state is illegitimate, time travel paradoxes, whether knowing the future changes it. The show forces viewers to question Kiera's assumptions—her future isn't obviously good. The terrorists might be heroes. Sophisticated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season escalates: terrorists to stop, future to change or preserve, paradoxes to resolve. The time travel mechanics develop across seasons; the moral complexity deepens. The pacing is solid for serialized sci-fi.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with conclusion. The final season was shortened but the ending resolves: Kiera's choice about the future, about Alec, about home. The time travel concludes appropriately. Complete despite budget cuts.</p>
