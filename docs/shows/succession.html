<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Logan Roy runs a media empire. His children want to inherit. They're awful. He's worse. Jesse Armstrong created Shakespearean tragedy as corporate satire: King Lear meets Murdoch, the Roys tearing each other apart for daddy's approval.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Brian Cox as Logan: the tyrant, the father, the void. Jeremy Strong as Kendall: the son who can't escape. Sarah Snook as Shiv: the daughter who can't win. Kieran Culkin as Roman: the chaos agent. Matthew Macfadyen as Tom: the survivor. The ensemble is the decade's best.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Media empire capitalism: the boardrooms, the private jets, the Waystar Royco empire, the political connections. The world is wealth as weapon—every resource deployed in the succession fight.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>HBO production: the private jets, the mansions, the corporate headquarters. The style is intimate chaos—handheld cameras in billionaires' palaces.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is wealth: the jets, the weddings, the funerals. The "spectacle" is the toxicity—watching rich people destroy each other.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Inheritance, what we owe to parents, whether love is possible in capitalism, media power, corruption as system. The show explores these through Shakespearean family tragedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (10/10)</h3><p>Who will inherit? Each season escalates the fight. The structure is succession—corporate and familial. The dialogue is sharper than anything on television.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Four seasons, complete. The finale is among television's most debated. The succession resolved; the tragedy complete. Essential television.</p></div></section>
