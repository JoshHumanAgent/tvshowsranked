            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>Succession is a Shakespearean tragedy about a media empire. Logan Roy (Brian Cox) is the founder of Waystar Royco—a Murdoch-like conglomerate. He's having health problems and hasn't named a successor. His children: Kendall (Jeremy Strong), theambitious but broken eldest son; Shiv (Sarah Snook), the political consultant who thinks she deserves the crown; Roman (Kieran Culkin), the crass, damaged youngest; and Connor (Alan Ruck), thedelusional eldest who runs for president. The show's opening line: "Can you hear me?" Logan asks. No one can, really. He's speaking to children who are already jockeying for hisposition.</p>
            <p>The show is about power and love—specifically, how power corrupts love and how the pursuit of power reveals brokenness. Kendall wants his father's approval and tries to destroy him when he doesn't get it. Shiv thinks she's the heir and watches her husband (Matthew Macfadyen) rise past her. Roman uses cruelty as armor. "I love you," they say to each other, andthey mean it, and they're also calculating how to use that love. "I love you, but you're not serious people," Logan tells his children. He's right. They're not serious. They're damaged children playingat business.</p>
            <p>The dialogue is acidic—insults become an art form. "You're not a killer," Logan tells Kendall. "You have to be a killer." The tragedy is: Logan is right. Kendall isn't a killer. He tries to be—he launches coups, he betrays his siblings, he hires fixers—and he fails. In the finale, he loses the company to a tech billionaire (Alexander Skarsgård). His younger brother becomes CEO. Kendall sits bythe water, his dream destroyed, his father dead, his siblings turned against him. "I'm the eldest boy," he insists. It doesn't matter. He never had it in him.</p>
            <p>Four seasons, thirty-nine episodes, complete. Succession is the best show about capitalism since The Wire. It's also hilarious—dark comedy in boardrooms and yachts and election nights. The finale is perfect: the siblings have one last pizza together, then betray each other forever. "We wouldn't have anything," Shiv says if they'd won. They'd have had each other. But they chose winning. They lost anyway. They have nothing.</p>
