            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Superheroes are real, and they're corporate products. Vought International markets the Seven—the premier superhero team—as celebrities and brands. But behind the PR, they're narcissists, predators, and worse. Billy Butcher leads a group of vigilantes determined to expose them. Garth Ennis's comic adapted by Eric Kripke: superhero deconstruction as ultra-violent satire.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Karl Urban as Butcher: the swagger, the violence, the hidden pain. Antony Starr as Homelander: smiling fascism, terrifying neediness. The ensemble (Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, Jessie T. Usher, Laz Alonso, Karen Fukuhara) creates the resistance. The performances embrace the excess.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>America where superheroes are commodified: Vought International, the Seven's tower, the Compound V that creates supers, the media machine. The world is corporate superheroism fully realized—complete with branding, propaganda, and accountability problems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Amazon Prime budget: superhero action rendered with detail, the ultra-violence staged with creativity, New York as Vought's playground. The style is kinetic and unflinching—the gore is the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Superhero violence: heads exploding, laser eyes through bodies, speedsters through crowds. The spectacle is deliberately excessive—superhero power without restraint. The effects are impressive and disturbing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Corporate power, celebrity culture, accountability, what happens when power is unchecked, the gap between public image and private horror. The show satirizes superhero culture while exploring real political themes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Butcher vs. Homelander, the Boys vs. Vought, secrets exposed, power dynamics shifting. The structure is revenge thriller meets superhero epic. The pacing is relentless—each season escalates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Four seasons completed with more planned. The central conflict (Butcher vs. Homelander) hasn't resolved. The show is building toward something but hasn't arrived. Incomplete but strong.</p>
