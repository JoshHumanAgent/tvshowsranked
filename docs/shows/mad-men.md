## What It Feels Like to Watch

Mad Men drops you into 1960s Manhattan, into the offices of Sterling Cooper, an advertising agency. The men wear fedoras and suits. The women take dictation. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air. And at the center is Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the creative director whose smile hides a secret.

This is prestige television before the term was popular. It's about advertising, yes, but really it's about America—the mythology we create, the lies we tell ourselves, the transformation of the 1960s that would reshape everything.

Jon Hamm is extraordinary. Don Draper is a man of contradictions—brilliant and broken, charming and cruel. You never fully understand him, and that's the point. Hamm plays him with the mystery of an empty suit, a man who might be anyone.

The ensemble is remarkable. Elisabeth Moss as Peggy Olson—the secretary who becomes a copywriter—is the heart of the series. Her journey from 1960 to 1970 mirrors the changes in America. The supporting cast—John Slattery, January Jones, Christina Hendricks—create a world that feels fully realized.

The production is gorgeous. Every frame looks like a photograph from the era. The attention to detail—the cars, the cigarettes, the office furniture—creates an immersive experience.

Mad Men is slow. It demands patience. But it rewards with one of the greatest series conclusions ever—a final image that says everything about the American dream.
