## What It Feels Like to Watch

Mad Men drops you into 1960s Manhattan, into the offices of Sterling Cooper, an advertising agency. The men wear fedoras and suits. The women take dictation. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air. And at the center is Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the creative director whose smile hides a secret.

This is prestige television before the term was popular. It's about advertising, yes, but really it's about America—the mythology we create, the lies we tell ourselves, the transformation of the 1960s that would reshape everything.

Jon Hamm is extraordinary. Don Draper is a man of contradictions—brilliant and broken, charming and cruel. You never fully understand him, and that's the point. Hamm plays him with the mystery of an empty suit, a man who might be anyone.

The ensemble is remarkable. Elisabeth Moss as Peggy Olson—the secretary who becomes a copywriter—is the heart of the series. Her journey from 1960 to 1970 mirrors the changes in America. The supporting cast—John Slattery, January Jones, Christina Hendricks—create a world that feels fully realized.

The production is gorgeous. Every frame looks like a photograph from the era. The attention to detail—the cars, the cigarettes, the office furniture—creates an immersive experience.

Mad Men is slow. It demands patience. But it rewards with one of the greatest series conclusions ever—a final image that says everything about the American dream.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.70**

Scoring 8.5, Jon Hamm's Don Draper is one of television's great performances—charming, empty, self-destructive, occasionally capable of genuine connection. The ensemble—Elisabeth Moss, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones, John Slattery, Christina Hendricks—creates a world of professionals performing competence while falling apart. Every character is a study in period performance.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

Scoring 8, 1960s New York is built through details—cigarettes in offices, martinis at lunch, casual misogyny as wallpaper. The advertising industry provides perfect lens for exploring American dreams and lies. The decade's progression—from Kennedy to Nixon—is mapped onto professional and personal lives.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

Scoring 7.5, the show looks gorgeous—period-perfect production design captured with careful composition. The visuals serve the era: bright colors giving way to film grain. It's consistently handsome without being visually revolutionary.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 0.85**

Scoring 8.5, spectacle arrives through period recreation—street scenes, parties, office life. The show's visual power comes from accumulation: how did people dress, smoke, drink, interact? The historical moments—Kennedy assassination, moon landing—provide anchor points.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

Scoring 8, Mad Men explores identity, consumerism, American mythology, and the lies men tell themselves. Don Draper as self-invention, as impostor syndrome given flesh. The show interrogates advertising's relationship to truth. It's thematically rich.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

Scoring 8, the show moves through seasons with accumulating weight. Each year brings new clients, new crises, new self-destruction. The narrative rewards patience with emotional payoff. The final season achieves genuine forward momentum.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.13**

Scoring 7.5, the finale—Don's smile, Peggy and Stan's confession, Pete and Trudy's reconciliation, Betty's fate—provides closure while acknowledging continuation. The Coke ad ending is debated: cynical or hopeful? Either way, it honors the show's ambivalence.
