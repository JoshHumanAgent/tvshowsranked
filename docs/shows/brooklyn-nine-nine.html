<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Jake Peralta is a detective who doesn't take anything seriously. Captain Holt is his new boss who takes everything seriously. Michael Schur and Dan Goor created police comedy that's actually funny: cases solved with jokes, found family in the precinct.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Andy Samberg as Jake: juvenile detective with skill. Andre Braugher as Captain Holt: deadpan perfection. The ensemble (Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz) creates the precinct as family.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>The 99th precinct: the bullpen, the cases, the relationships. The world is workplace sitcom—specific through character.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>Single-camera sitcom: bright, fast-paced, the visual language of network comedy. Functional.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is occasionally the cases—murder mysteries played for comedy. Light spectacle.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (4/10)</h3><p>Friendship, workplace found family, growing up. Light themes. The show addressed police issues in later seasons but mostly it's comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Episodic cases, serialized relationships. Jake's growth; Holt's humanity revealed. The drive is character-driven comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Eight seasons, complete. The flash-forward finale gives everyone their ending. A satisfying sitcom conclusion.</p></div></section>
