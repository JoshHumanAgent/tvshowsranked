<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Twelve amateur bakers compete in a tent. They bake signature dishes, technical challenges, and showstoppers. One is eliminated each week. There's no prize money—just glory. The kindest competition on television: people help each other, the judges are supportive, the tent is sanctuary.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3><p>The bakers are the characters: amateur home bakers with passion. The judges (Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith) critique with encouragement. The hosts provide puns. Each season introduces a new cast of lovable bakers.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>The tent: the white tent in the British countryside, the bunting, the ovens, the challenges. The world is bake-off—every season the same, every season different bakers.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Channel 4/Netflix production: cakes photographed like art, bakes in close-up, the tent in golden light. The style is comfort—the most soothing show on television.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the bakes: showstoppers that are art, technical challenges that are precise, cakes that are architectural. The food is photographed beautifully.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3><p>Competition without cruelty, excellence for its own sake, Britishness, kindness as television. The themes are light—this is comfort viewing.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Each week: signature, technical, showstopper. Elimination. The drive is the competition—but gentle. Who will be Star Baker? Who will leave? The structure is reliable comfort.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Ongoing. Each season resolves with a winner. The format continues. No endpoint—comfort television that runs forever.</p></div></section>
