            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A lone gunman and his foundling, riding across the frontier. It's Western mythology transplanted to a galaxy far, far away—the Man with No Name, the child he can't abandon, the code he lives by. Star Wars stripped to its roots: smugglers, bounty hunters, strange cantinas, weirder creatures. Pedro Pascal's helmet never comes off, but his eyes are in his voice. The show reminds you what you loved about Star Wars before it became an industry.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Din Djarin is stoic, principled, emotionally constipated—and Pedro Pascal conveys all of it through body language and voice. Grogu (Baby Yoda) is a merchandising phenomenon and genuinely affecting character. The supporting cast rotates: Carl Weathers, Gina Carano, Giancarlo Esposito, Katee Sackhoff. Quality varies, but the core relationship—Mandalorian and foundling—anchors the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>This is Star Wars as lived-in universe: remote planets, obscure cultures, the remnants of Empire and the chaos of the New Republic. The show expands Star Wars without breaking it—Mandalorian lore, Jedi mythology, the politics of a post-Imperial galaxy. Jon Favreau understands that world-building is texture: strange creatures, unfamiliar customs, languages we don't speak.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Volume—Disney's LED wall technology—creates immersive environments without green screen artifacts. The show looks unlike anything on television: cinematic scope, practical effects blended with digital backgrounds. Western compositions: wide shots, lone figures against landscapes, showdown lighting. This is TV that looks like film.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Star Wars delivered weekly: space battles, creature effects, lightsaber duels, epic landscapes. The budget is bottomless, and it shows. Each episode features at least one sequence that would be a film highlight. The spectacle serves story—Grogu's Force powers, the Dark Trooper assault, the spiders of Torment—but spectacle is essential to the experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores the Mandalorian creed: honor, foundlings, tribal identity. It asks what it means to belong to something larger than yourself. But these themes play second fiddle to adventure. This is popcorn entertainment elevated by execution, not philosophical television disguised as action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic with serialized elements. Each season has a quest structure: deliver the child, find a Jedi, save a planet. The drive is consistent but not relentless. Some episodes feel like diversions; others are essential. The show is comfortable being a Western serial—some adventures matter to the arc, some don't. Patient viewers will appreciate the pacing; others may find it slow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show has no ending yet—each season resolves certain elements while opening others. The Mandalorian Creed is tested, the relationship with Grogu evolves, the galaxy remains in flux. The series serves Disney's larger Star Wars plans, which means conclusions are perpetually deferred. Quality remains high, but resolution remains future-tense.</p>
