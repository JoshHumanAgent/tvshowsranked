## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Boys is a vicious, irreverent take on superhero culture that pulls no punches. Based on Garth Ennis's comic books, it asks: What if superheroes were corrupt, morally bankrupt celebrities sponsored by a mega-corporation?

You watch The Boys and feel both the thrill of action and the discomfort of satire. Homelander is the most powerful superhero—and also a violent psychopath. The Seven are supposed to be heroes, but they're petty, abusive, and dangerous.

The series is violent, profane, and frequently disturbing. But beneath the shock value lies sharp social commentary about celebrity culture, corporate power, and the weaponization of heroism.

Karl Urban's Billy Butcher leads a group of vigilantes seeking to expose and destroy the superheroes. His vendetta against Homelander drives the narrative. The ensemble is rounded out by characters who challenge your assumptions about heroism.
