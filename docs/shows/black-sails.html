            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Captain Flint fights for Nassau's survival against civilization. Long John Silver becomes his quartermaster. Pirates, privateers, and empires collide in the Golden Age of Piracy's final days. Toby Stephens is Flint; Luke Arnold is Silver. Robert Levine and Jonathan E. Steinberg created the Treasure Island prequel: pirates as revolutionaries.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Toby Stephens as Flint: the most complex pirate captain on screen—intellectual, brutal, idealistic. Luke Arnold as Silver: the con artist becoming something more. Hannah New as Eleanor, Jessica Parker Kennedy as Max. The ensemble is exceptional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Nassau 1715: the pirate republic, the British Empire, the Spanish Main, the trade routes. The world is complete—politics, economics, alliances, betrayals. The pirate world is rendered with historical specificity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz production: ships at sea, Nassau's streets, the Caribbean rendered with mud and blood. The style is feature-quality television. The sea battles are staged with practical ships.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Naval battles, pirate raids, storms at sea, boarding actions. The spectacle is feature-quality—real ships, real stunts, real explosions. Pirate television at its most ambitious.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>What pirates really were, why civilization creates outlaws, the economics of empire, whether a pirate republic can survive, what we owe to our stories. Profound historical drama disguised as adventure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Flint's war against civilization, Silver's rise, Nassau's survival, the treasure that will become Treasure Island. The structure is four seasons of escalation. Each season raises the stakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with planned ending. The story connects to Treasure Island; the characters reach their fates. The ending is satisfying and mythic. Complete.</p>
