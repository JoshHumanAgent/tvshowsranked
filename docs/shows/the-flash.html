            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Barry Allen is a forensic scientist struck by lightning who gains superspeed. He becomes the Flash, protects Central City, and searches for his mother's killer. Grant Gustin is Barry: earnest, optimistic, always running into danger. Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg created the CW superhero: lighter than Arrow, more emotional than most. Nine seasons of speed.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Grant Gustin is the heart: the Flash as hopeful hero. The ensemble (Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Jesse L. Martin) creates Team Flash. The villains (Tom Cavanagh, Matt Letscher) provide the threat. The performances are CW earnest—committed to the material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Central City, Star Labs, the Speed Force, the multiverse. The Flash builds the Arrowverse's cosmic scale: time travel, alternate earths, Crisis on Infinite Earths. The mythology is deep and connected.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>CW superhero production: speed effects, lightning, villain powers. The effects are budget-constrained but improving across seasons. The style is bright and hopeful—the Flash aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Speed: running through time, phasing through walls, lightning throws. The spectacle is superhero television—enough to sell the powers, constrained by CW budget. The multiverse allows creative set pieces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Legacy, responsibility, whether we can change our pasts, the cost of heroism. The themes are present in the speed force mythology. The show explores family and grief through sci-fi metaphor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a Big Bad: Reverse-Flash, Zoom, Savitar, DeVoe. The structure is consistent: the threat arrives, Barry struggles, Barry overcomes. The drive is reliable superhero formula.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Nine seasons with conclusion. The show declined in later seasons but stuck the landing. The finale provided closure for Barry and Team Flash. Complete within the Arrowverse.</p>
