## What It Feels Like to Watch

Marty Byrde is a financial adviser who makes one terrible decision. When his business partner steals from a Mexican drug cartel, Marty offers to launder money in the Missouri Ozarks to save his life. What follows is a descent into darkness that consumes his entire family.

*Ozark* is often compared to *Breaking Bad*, and the comparison is apt. Both are about ordinary men who become monsters. Both explore how crime corrodes the soul. But *Ozark* has its own rhythm — slower, more deliberate, with a visual palette that's all cool blues and shadow.

Jason Bateman is revelatory as Marty. Known for comedy, he delivers a performance of contained panic — a man always calculating, always maneuvering, always three moves ahead even as the ground shifts beneath him. You see the strain in his eyes, the cost of maintaining control.

Laura Linney is equally good as his wife Wendy, who transforms over the series from reluctant accomplice to active participant. Their marriage becomes the show's most complex relationship — two people bound by secrets, increasingly complicit in each other's crimes.

Julia Garner's Ruth Langmore is the breakout character — a local criminal who becomes entangled with the Byrdes and provides the show's moral center, such as it is. Her journey from petty thief to major player is one of the great character arcs in recent television.

The show is relentless. Every season raises the stakes. The Byrdes accumulate enemies — the cartel, local criminals, the FBI, rival politicians — and they survive through a combination of intelligence, ruthlessness, and sheer luck. By the finale, you understand that there's no redemption coming, only escape.

The final episodes are controversial but fitting. The Byrdes get what they wanted. Whether they deserved it is a question the show leaves unanswered.
