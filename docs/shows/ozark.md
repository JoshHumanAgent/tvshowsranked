## The Landscape

Marty Byrde's money laundering operation goes wrong—so he moves his family to the Ozarks to launder for a drug cartel. What follows is a slow descent into moral compromise, with each season adding new layers of violence and consequence.

## The Characters

Marty: the man who can talk himself out of anything until he can't. Wendy: the wife who becomes more ruthless than her husband. Ruth: the local who becomes something more. Each transformation is earned, each choice is costly.

## What It Feels Like

Like Breaking Blue—the blue-tinted noir to Breaking Bad's desert orange. Like watching Jason Bateman discover he's a great dramatic actor. Like Netflix's answer to prestige crime drama.

## Julia Garner's Ruth

A breakout performance that steals every scene. Her Missouri accent, her ferocity, her vulnerability. Ruth Langmore becomes the soul of the show.
