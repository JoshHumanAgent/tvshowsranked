            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Shim Deok-chul is 70 years old. He's never learned ballet, but it's his secret dream. Chae-rok is a young ballet dancer whose dreams are dying. They meet, they learn from each other, they give each other hope. Park In-hwan and Song Kang star in the Korean drama about dreams that don't fade with age.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Park In-hwan as Deok-chul: the 70-year-old whose life was duty, finally chasing his dream. Song Kang as Chae-rok: the damaged young dancer who's lost his way. The intergenerational friendship is the heart. The performances are gentle and genuine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Seoul ballet: the studio, the rehearsals, the performances, the financial struggles. The world is intimate—two people finding each other through their dreams. K-drama family dynamics provide texture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama production: ballet photographed with attention, the generational differences visualized, Seoul as backdrop. The style is warm—this is humanist drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The ballet: the training, the rehearsals, the eventual performances. The spectacle is the art form—watching a 70-year-old attempt ballet. The emotion is the real show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Dreams and age, whether it's ever too late, intergenerational connection, the cost of sacrifice, what we owe to ourselves vs. others. The show explores these through the ballet metaphor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Deok-chul wants to perform before he dies. Chae-rok needs to rediscover his love. Each episode brings them closer to performance and further from despair. The structure is inspirational.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete. The performance happens. The dreams are realized. The ending is emotional and appropriate. Korean drama with proper conclusion and emotional payoff.</p>
