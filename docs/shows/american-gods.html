            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Shadow Moon gets out of prison and meets Mr. Wednesday—a con man who's actually Odin. The old gods are real, they're in America, and they're at war with the new gods of technology and media. Neil Gaiman's novel adapted by Bryan Fuller and Michael Green: road trip mythology, immigrant stories, gods among us.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Ian McShane as Mr. Wednesday: the Odin con man, all charm and danger. Ricky Whittle as Shadow: the audience surrogate walking into myth. The gods: Pablo Schreiber's Mad Sweeney, Yetide Badaki's Bilquis, Orlando Jones's Mr. Nancy. The performances embrace the mythic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>The gods of America: the old gods brought by immigrants, fading as belief wanes; the new gods of technology, media, globalization. The world is mythology in modern America—backroads motels, roadside attractions, hidden temples. Complete and specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Bryan Fuller's style: saturated colors, dreamlike sequences, the mythic rendered visible. Each god's introduction is a visual tour de force. The style IS the substance—the gods are real because we see them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The arrival sequences: the gods introduced through their believers. The sex scene with Bilquis devouring a worshipper. Mad Sweeney's coin tricks. The spectacle is mythological—gods showing their power.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Belief and power, immigration and identity, old America vs. new America, whether the gods need us or we need them. The show explores what happens when cultures collide and what survives the journey. Gaiman's themes are present and expanded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 is road trip: Shadow and Wednesday gathering allies. The pace is deliberate—Fuller prioritizes style over momentum. Season 2 and 3 struggled with leadership changes and the story fragmenting. The drive varies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, incomplete. Fuller left after season 1; the show never recovered. The third season finale was not intended as ending. The novel continues; the adaptation stopped. Beautiful but unfinished.</p>
