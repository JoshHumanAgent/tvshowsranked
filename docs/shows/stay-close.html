            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Cush Jumbo as Megan, James Nesbitt as Ray, Richard Armitage as Broome. The ensemble creates the web of secrets. The performances are thriller-competent—everyone has something to hide.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Suburban Atlantic City: the comfortable life, the strip clubs of the past, the missing persons who connect them. The world is noir hidden in suburbia—two Americas, one visible, one buried.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix Coben production: suburbia and strip clubs, past and present, the contrast between who they were and who they are now. The style is thriller standard.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is thriller-standard: chases, reveals, confrontations. The "spectacle" is the plot twists—Coben's trademark surprises. Thriller mechanics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Whether we can escape our pasts, suburban perfection as mask, the cost of reinvention, obsession vs. justice. The themes are present but secondary to the plot. Coben thriller depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The past returns: Megan's secrets surface, Ray's photographs resurface, Broome's cold case heats up. The structure is thriller momentum—each episode reveals more connections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The connections are revealed, the past is confronted, the endings are provided. Coben adaptations are designed for resolution. Satisfying.</p>
