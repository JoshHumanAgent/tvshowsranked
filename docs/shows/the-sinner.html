            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A woman stabs a man on a beach. Why? She doesn't know. Detective Harry Ambrose investigates not who did it—she did—but why. Each season is a self-contained mystery: not who, but why. Bill Pullman as Ambrose (the detective with his own demons), Jessica Biel in season 1, different cases each season. Derek Simonds created the inverted detective story: the mystery is the motive.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Bill Pullman as Harry Ambrose is the constant: damaged, intuitive, unable to let go. Each season adds a new guest star playing the perpetrator: Jessica Biel (Emmy-nominated), Carrie Coon, Matt Bomer. The performances are committed—the trauma is believable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Small-town America, upstate New York, wealthy enclaves. Each season builds a specific world around its crime. The world serves the mystery—the secrets are buried in the community.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>USA Network production elevated: the beach, the forest, the interrogation rooms. The style is moody—everything is slightly off, supporting the psychological mystery. The dream sequences are distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is psychological investigation: interviews, flashbacks, trauma excavation. The "spectacle" is the revelation—watching the past emerge. Intimate mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Trauma, memory, whether understanding why helps, the cost of secrets, how the past shapes the present. Each season explores why good people do terrible things. The psychology is the mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season is limited (8 episodes): the crime, the investigation, the revelation. The drive is the "why"—what happened in the past that made this inevitable? The pacing is propulsive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with standalone mysteries. The first season is strongest; subsequent seasons maintain the formula with diminishing returns. Each season resolves; Ambrose's character arc continues.</p>
