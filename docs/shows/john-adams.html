            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The American Revolution as personal struggle. John Adams is not the hero schoolbooks remember—he's vain, stubborn, argumentative, often wrong. Paul Giamatti plays him as a man who does the right thing for the wrong reasons, or the wrong thing for the right ones, and never knows which is which. Abigail Adams is his equal, his conscience, his partner in every sense. The founding looks like what it was: desperate men improvising a nation.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Paul Giamatti is transformative—a Founding Father as difficult, brilliant, insecure man. Laura Linney as Abigail is his exact match: intellectual equal, moral center, political partner. The supporting cast reads like a highlight reel: Tom Wilkinson as Franklin, David Morse as Washington, Stephen Dillane as Jefferson. Every performance is considered, historically grounded, emotionally resonant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>18th-century America rendered in forensic detail: the clothing, the disease, the dentistry, the politics. The production design shows that revolution wasn't glorious—it was uncomfortable, dangerous, uncertain. We see the inoculation of the Adams children against smallpox; we watch the toll of separation on a marriage. History as lived experience, not as pageant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production values: natural light, location shooting, period authenticity. The camera observes without embellishment. Battle sequences are chaotic rather than heroic—the opposite of patriotic filmmaking. The style serves content: this is how it looked, not how we wish it looked.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is historical: Independence Hall, the courts of Europe, presidential mansions. The show isn't about large-scale action; it's about rooms where decisions were made. The spectacle of ideas being debated, the spectacle of a nation being argued into existence. Satisfying in its own restrained way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show dramatizes political philosophy: What is liberty? What is the role of government? How do idealists govern? The Adams-Jefferson relationship is the central philosophical tension—aristocracy vs. democracy, federal power vs. states' rights. These debates remain unresolved. The show forces us to live inside them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The pace is deliberate—this is history as it was lived, not accelerated for drama. Seven episodes cover 50 years. Some viewers will find it slow; others will appreciate the breath. The drive is intellectual rather than visceral: we watch to see how arguments resolve, not how battles turn.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete story with a perfect ending: aged Adams and Jefferson, both dying on July 4, 1826—exactly 50 years after the Declaration. The final episode is devastating, the correspondence between old enemies reconciled by time. The show knows where it's going and arrives with grace. Among the best biographical miniseries ever made.</p>
