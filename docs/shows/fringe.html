            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                FBI agent Olivia Dunham investigates "fringe science"—cases involving parallel universes, shapeshifters, and phenomena on the edge of reality. She recruits Dr. Walter Bishop, a brilliant scientist institutionalized for 17 years. His son Peter helps manage him. JJ Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci created X-Files for the 21st century: episode-of-the-week plus serialized mythology.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Anna Torv as Olivia Dunham is the center: grounded, determined, increasingly strange. John Noble as Walter Bishop is the soul: brilliant, damaged, funny, tragic. Joshua Jackson as Peter provides the normal. The trio creates one of TV's best ensembles. Multiple versions of characters across universes showcase the range.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Two universes at war, the Observers, the Pattern, the Cortexiphan trials. The mythology expands across seasons—parallel universes, time travel, dystopic futures. The world is built with care and consistency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Fox production with JJ Abrams style: lens flares, blue tint, the fringe cases rendered with budget. The parallel universe is distinguished through subtle visual differences. The style is atmospheric.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Fringe science: transformations, alternate universes, time manipulation, the Observers' abilities. The spectacle is TV-budget sci-fi, deployed creatively. The monsters-of-the-week are memorable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Parallel universes, the cost of scientific progress, father-son dynamics, identity across realities, whether we can change fate. The show explores its sci-fi concepts philosophically. Walter's past haunts the present.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Pattern drives early seasons. The parallel universe drives the middle. The Observers drive the end. The structure balances monster-of-the-week with serialized mythology. The drive is constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with planned ending. The final season jumps to the Observer-controlled future; the finale provides resolution. The ending completes the arc. Focused and complete.</p>
