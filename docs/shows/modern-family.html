            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Jay Pritchett has a younger wife. His daughter Claire has three kids and a husband who thinks he's cool. His son Mitchell has a partner and an adopted daughter. Three households, one family. Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan created the definitive millennial sitcom: mockumentary style, warm heart, cultural diversity as norm. 11 seasons of comfort.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Ed O'Neill as Jay, Julie Bowen as Claire, Ty Burrell as Phil, Sofia Vergara as Gloria, Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Mitchell, Eric Stonestreet as Cam. The ensemble won 22 Emmys across its run. The child actors grow up on screen. The performances define the characters.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Suburban Los Angeles: the Dunphy house, Jay and Gloria's house, Mitch and Cam's apartment. The world expands as kids grow, marriages evolve, careers change. The mockumentary format makes the world feel real.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Mockumentary style inherited from The Office: talking heads, handheld cameras, zooms. The style is familiar and functional—this is comfort television, not visual innovation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is families in houses: dinners, arguments, vacations. The "spectacle" is family dynamics—watching people love and annoy each other. Comedy without production.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Family, acceptance, generational change, what makes a modern family. The show normalizes same-sex parents, interracial marriage, adoption. The themes are warmth; the depth is limited. Comfort comedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic comedy with serialized aging: the kids grow up, get married, have kids. The drive is life—watching a family evolve across 11 years. The structure is sitcom reliable; the growth is genuine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>11 seasons with appropriate ending. The finale sees kids moving out, parents adjusting to empty nests. The ending is warm without being maudlin. A generation's sitcom, complete.</p>
