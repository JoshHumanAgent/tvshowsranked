            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                James Delaney returns to London after his father's death. Everyone thinks he's dead. He's not. He wants his inheritance: a piece of land that the East India Company needs. Tom Hardy is Delaney: feral, dangerous, possibly supernatural. Steven Knight created the darkest period thriller on television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Tom Hardy as James Delaney: a force of nature, grunting, dangerous, magnetic. The supporting cast (Oona Chaplin, Stephen Graham, Jonathan Pryce) matches his intensity. Hardy carries the show through sheer presence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1814 London: the East India Company, the docks, the empire's corruption, the supernatural elements that may or may not be real. The world is historical London rendered as gothic nightmare.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC/FX production: London rendered in mud, fog, and fire. The style is gothic—Delaney moves through nightmare London. The photography is feature-quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is atmosphere: the fog, the fires, the violence, the rituals. The action is brutal but sparse. The spectacle is the world itself—London as Delaney's domain.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Empire and corruption, what we inherit from our fathers, whether trauma can be weaponized, the supernatural in rationalist London. The show explores these through Delaney's fury.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Delaney vs. the East India Company: his inheritance, his mother's history, his plans. The structure is chess—everyone is a piece. The drive is Delaney's revenge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>One season, season 2 planned but delayed. The first season resolves the immediate conflict but the larger story is incomplete. Hardy and Knight promise continuation. Waiting.</p>
