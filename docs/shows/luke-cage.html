            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Luke Cage was the Marvel Netflix show that understood that superheroes are most interesting when they're rooted in specific places and communities. Harlem isn't just a backdrop for Cage's bulletproof adventures; it's the reason for them, the place he protects because it's home, because the people there are his people. Mike Colter plays Cage as a reluctant hero with a moral center that isn't preachy but is unwavering, a man who would prefer to be left alone but won't stand aside when his community is threatened.</p>

            <p>The first season creates a Harlem that feels genuine—a world of barbershops and nightclubs, community activists and crime bosses, history that goes back further than any Marvel continuity. Cottonmouth, played with real presence by Mahershala Ali, is one of the MCU's better villains: a man whose criminal enterprise is inseparable from his community investment, whose violence serves a vision of Harlem's future that has nothing to do with the Avengers. When Cage fights him, it's not a battle between good and evil but between visions of what the neighborhood could be.</p>

            <p>Where Luke Cage struggles is in its second season and in the broader Netflix Marvel commitment to thirteen-episode seasons. The first season's plot extends past its natural endpoint, and the second season fails to find an antagonist as compelling as Cottonmouth. But even at its most padded, the show maintains a distinctive voice and visual identity—a love for Harlem, an appreciation for black culture and history, a conviction that superhero stories can be about something other than saving the world. Luke Cage was canceled before its time, and it remains a road-not-taken for what the MCU could have been.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Luke Cage earns its ranking through place-specific storytelling, community focus, and a lead performance that makes virtue compelling. The score reflects a first season that ranks among Marvel's best television work and a second season that doesn't reach that level.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Mike Colter's Cage is a charismatic presence—physically imposing but emotionally intelligent, capable of violence that never seems cruel. Mahershala Ali's Cottonmouth is the show's highlight: a villain with genuine philosophy and presence. Alfre Woodard brings complexity to what could have been a stock scheming politician. The ensemble captures Harlem as a community of distinct voices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Harlem is rendered as a living place with history, culture, and economic forces that shape character options. The show draws on real Harlem history—the Harlem Renaissance, the civil rights era, gentrification pressures—and makes those currents part of its storytelling. The superhero elements integrate into this world rather than overwhelming it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach distinguishes itself from other Marvel properties through color and rhythm. Harlem's streets are shot with attention to architecture and community, and the action sequences are staged with clarity. The show looks like it was made by people who know the neighborhood, not a generic urban backdrop.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Cage's bulletproof nature allows for action sequences where he walks through gunfire—visually distinctive and thematically effective. The spectacle is street-level rather than cosmic: fights in clubs and streets rather than battles for reality. The action serves character rather than overwhelming it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages with questions about community protection, the ethics of vigilantism, and the relationship between legal and extralegal authority in neighborhoods where official channels have failed. Cage is explicitly positioned as a black superhero in a tradition of community defense, and the show takes that positioning seriously.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season maintains momentum through Cottonmouth's arc, though it extends past its natural conclusion. The second season struggles to find the same drive without an antagonist of equivalent presence. The thirteen-episode format creates padding that shorter seasons wouldn't have.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season resolves its primary conflict effectively, though the second villain introduced in the back half feels like a reset. The second season ends on cliffhangers that cancellation made permanent. The show works best as a first-season story that never got the conclusion it deserved.</p>
