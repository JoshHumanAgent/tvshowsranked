            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A young mother flees an emotionally abusive relationship with her toddler. She has $17. She starts cleaning houses. The show follows Alex through the labyrinth of American poverty: Section 8 housing waiting lists, food stamps, custody battles, the impossible math of low-wage work. Margaret Qualley's performance is exhausted and determined; Andie MacDowell (her real mother) plays her mother, navigating her own instability. Stephanie Land's memoir adapted into television that makes visible the invisible labor of survival.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Margaret Qualley is the heart—the exhaustion, the determination, the moments of joy snatched from struggle. Andie MacDowell as her mother brings lived-in complexity to mental illness. Nick Robinson as the ex navigates sympathy and rage: he's not a villain, just a man who refuses to grow. The supporting cast—cleaning clients, social workers, shelter residents—creates a complete ecosystem of precarity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Washington State's Olympic Peninsula as setting: beauty and poverty coexisting. The world is the bureaucracy of survival: benefits offices, courtrooms, shelters, the houses Alex cleans. The show teaches by showing: how domestic abuse includes financial and emotional control, how "just leave" is impossible when you have no money, how government "help" requires endless hoop-jumping. Educational without lecturing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The Pacific Northwest is beautiful—too beautiful, almost, for the poverty it screens. The show uses visual contrast: Alex in wealthy homes she can't afford, nature's majesty indifferent to human struggle. The camera stays close on faces, capturing exhaustion and hope in equal measure. Functional beauty.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. The drama is domestic: fighting for benefits, navigating co-parenting, cleaning toilets. The spectacle is systemic: watching a person navigate a system designed to exhaust them. The "action" is bureaucratic—forms, appointments, appeals. Powerfully unspectacular.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Invisible labor, emotional abuse, the poverty trap, maternal determination. The show explores abuse without bruises—the controlling behavior, the money manipulation, the weaponized incompetence. It examines how systems fail the people they're designed to help. The conceptual framework is feminist economics: care work is work, survival is labor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Ten episodes of mounting stakes. Will Alex keep Maddy? Will she find housing? Will she finish college? Each episode brings a new obstacle and small victories. The pacing is propulsive without melodrama. The show respects the exhaustion of poverty while maintaining momentum. Binge-worthy in the best sense.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries with satisfying ending. Alex gets her degree, finds stable housing, gains co-parenting equilibrium. The ending isn't triumphant—she's still poor, still struggling—but she's stable, she has options. The resolution respects the ongoing nature of survival while delivering emotional closure. Perfectly constructed.</p>
