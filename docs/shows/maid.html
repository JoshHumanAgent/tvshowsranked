            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Maid is a limited series about a young mother escaping an abusive relationship and trying to build a life for herself and her daughter on income from housecleaning. Based on Stephanie Land's memoir, it's a show about poverty—not the romanticized version, but the grinding reality of bureaucracy, judgment, and impossible choices that compound each other into exhaustion. Margaret Qualley plays Alex with a determination that never becomes heroism; she's surviving, not triumphing, and the distinction matters.</p>

            <p>The show's achievement is in making visible what's usually invisible: the labor of cleaning, the emotional work of caring for a child while exhausted, the navigation of government systems designed more to exclude than help. Alex cleans houses for rich clients whose lives she can see but not touch, and the contrast between her precarity and their ease is constant without being preachy. The homes she cleans become windows into different kinds of unhappiness—no amount of money solves the human problems she glimpses, though money would certainly solve hers.</p>

            <p>Maid doesn't offer easy hope. When systems help, it feels earned rather than granted; when they fail, it feels inevitable rather than dramatic. Andie MacDowell plays Alex's mother with the particular chaos of untreated mental illness—the love that can't be relied on, the presence that's more unpredictable than absence. The father of Alex's child, played by Nick Robinson, is the particular kind of abuser whose damage isn't obvious enough to be villainous; he's just volatile enough, neglectful enough, to make leaving necessary and staying tempting. This is one of the best shows about poverty American television has produced.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Maid earns its high ranking through unflinching honesty, Margaret Qualley's committed performance, and a refusal to simplify poverty into entertainment. The score reflects a limited series that accomplishes everything it attempts.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Margaret Qualley carries the show with a performance that's all physical and emotional detail—the way exhaustion accumulates, the way hope gets harder each time it's disappointed. Andie MacDowell as her mother creates a character whose mental illness is real and whose impact is loving and destructive simultaneously. Every supporting performance creates specific people rather than types.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show captures the texture of poverty with documentary precision: the government offices, the transitional housing, the client homes that Alex cleans. Each space feels specific, real, and appropriately constrictive. The bureaucratic world is rendered with the particular frustration of people trying to help within systems that don't.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Visual intimacy that matches the material: close-ups that capture emotional detail, spaces that feel inhabited, a style that serves the story without drawing attention. The contrast between client homes and Alex's living situations is visual, not highlighted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. The visual interest is entirely in faces and spaces, in watching people try to navigate impossible circumstances. This is appropriate to the material but limits visual engagement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show genuinely explores poverty as a system rather than a personal failing—how government programs create obstacles, how domestic violence traps through financial control, how judgment compounds difficulty. It understands that escaping poverty requires more than hard work; it requires luck help and systems that function.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode advances Alex's situation incrementally—forward and backward, the two-step of poverty. The ten-episode count is appropriate; more would dilute, fewer would rush. The narrative creates tension without manufacturing drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending provides resolution that feels earned: a moment of stability that doesn't promise permanent triumph. Alex achieves enough to continue, which is more accurate than the transformation narratives poverty usually receives on television. The show understands that success is surviving with dignity.</p>
