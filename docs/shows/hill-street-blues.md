## What It Feels Like to Watch

Hill Street Blues changed television drama forever. Before this, cop shows were clean, simple, and morally straightforward. After Hill Street Blues, they were messy, complicated, and morally gray.

The show follows the officers and staff of a fictional police station in an unnamed American city. Every character is flawed, struggling, human. The captain, Furillo, is a good man doing an impossible job. The officers below him are a mix of dedicated professionals and compromised individuals.

You watch Hill Street Blues and feel the weight of the job. These are people trying to do right in a world that makes it nearly impossible. The cases are gritty, the personal lives are complicated, and nobody gets a clean victory.

The series pioneered techniques that are now standard—overlapping dialogue, ensemble storytelling, serialized character arcs. It earned a record 26 Emmy Awards and influenced everything from NYPD Blue to The Wire.
