            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>The Last of Us is the best video game adaptation ever made. That sounds like a low bar until you watch it and realize it's one of the best post-apocalyptic stories ever made in any medium. Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann took a game built on cinematic storytelling and made it into actual cinema, expanding without diluting, changing what needed to change while preserving the emotional core that made players cry in 2013.</p>
            <p>Joel is a smuggler in a world twenty years gone to fungus. Civilization collapsed when a parasitic infection turned people into violent creatures. He lost his daughter on outbreak day. He's been surviving, not living, ever since. Then he's asked to transport a fourteen-year-old girl named Ellie across the country. She's immune. She might be the cure. The journey is everything.</p>
            <p>Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are perfect. Pascal's Joel is a man who has shut down every part of himself that could feel—the trauma of losing his daughter calcified into a survival instinct that has no room for attachment. Ramsey's Ellie is fierce, funny, damaged in ways she doesn't yet understand, desperate to matter. Their relationship is the show's entire engine. It's not father and daughter; it's not mentor and student; it's two broken people learning that they might still have something worth protecting.</p>
            <p>The third episode, "Long Long Time," is among television's finest hours. It abandons the main characters entirely to tell the story of Bill and Frank, a survivalist and the man who stumbles into his traps. Their relationship spans decades, shown in compressed snapshots of tenderness in a world that offers none. It's a love story in the apocalypse, and it's devastating.</p>
            <p>The show understands that the best zombie stories aren't about zombies. They're about what people do when the structures fall away, what bonds form in the absence of society, what sacrifices are worth making for people you've just met. The infected are background. The foreground is always human.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Characters & Acting (9):</strong> Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey create something special. Their chemistry evolves across the series, from hostility to trust to something like family. Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett's single-episode romance is Emmy-worthy.</p>
            <p><strong>World Building (9):</strong> The post-apocalypse is lived-in and specific. The quarantine zones, the infected, the failed attempts at society—all feel real. The show trusts you to understand the world from context rather than explanation.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual Spectacle (9):</strong> The production design is feature-film quality. The infected are horrifying without being overused. The landscape of an empty America is beautiful and terrible.</p>
