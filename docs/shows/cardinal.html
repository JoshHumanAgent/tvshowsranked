            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Algonquin Bay, Ontario. Detective John Cardinal investigates crimes in a small Canadian city where the cold is a character and the dark secrets don't stay buried. Billy Campbell is Cardinal—brilliant, burdened, hiding something. Karine Vanasse is Lise Delorme, his partner, assigned to investigate him. Northern noir with the starkness of True Detective and the intimacy of small-town crime.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Billy Campbell's Cardinal is haunted—by his wife's mental illness, by a case he couldn't solve, by debts he owes to dangerous people. Karine Vanasse as Delorme provides the tension: she's investigating him while partnering with him. The guest stars each season bring distinct villains. Canadian crime drama at its best.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Algonquin Bay (based on North Bay, Ontario) is specific: the cold, the isolation, the indigenous communities nearby, the small-city politics. The setting isn't interchangeable—it matters that this is Canada, winter, where people go to disappear. The world is atmosphere as geography.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The cold is visible: breath, snow, the grey-blue of northern winter. The photography emphasizes isolation—landscapes that swallow people, interiors that feel temporary. Visual storytelling supports the mood: this is a place where secrets freeze but don't die.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. Crime scenes, interrogations, the northern landscape. The "spectacle" is the cold and the case—the show is procedural rather than cinematic. Nordic noir sensibility translated to Canadian winter.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Guilt, duty, the weight of unsolved cases, the moral complexity of good cops with secrets. Cardinal takes money from criminals; Delorme is investigating him; they solve crimes together. The themes are familiar but executed well.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season adapts a Giles Blunt novel: one case, six episodes. The structure is serialized—the case develops, the partnership develops, Cardinal's secrets develop. The pacing is propulsive without being frantic. Quality binge viewing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with conclusion. Each season resolves its case; the final season resolves Cardinal's arc. The ending respects the character and the story. Complete and satisfying.</p>
