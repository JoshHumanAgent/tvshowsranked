            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The zombie uprising is over. The dead have been treated, medicated, and returned to their families. Kieren Walker is a PDS sufferer (Partially Deceased Syndrome)—he eats people, remembers it, is sent back to the village where he died and killed. Dominic Mitchell's creation is zombie as metaphor: mental illness, queerness, the return of the repressed. Northern England as backdrop, small-town prejudice as antagonist, the living as monsters worse than the dead.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Luke Newberry as Kieren is extraordinary: a teenager who killed, died, and must now live among his victims. His stillness, his guilt, his tentative hope. The supporting cast—Harriet Cains as his sister, Steve Cooper and Marie Critchley as his parents—creates a family navigating the impossible. The PDS community is rendered with specific humanity. Acting that makes metaphor feel personal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Village: Northern England after the Rising. The PDS Centre where the dead are treated. The Volunteer Force that fought zombies now targets the treated. The show creates complete social dynamics: prejudice against the returned, laws requiring medication and makeup, the underground of untreated dead. The world is specific, politically charged, emotionally resonant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC Three production values: modest budget, effective design. The makeup on PDS sufferers communicates their otherness; the village settings feel real. The style is functional, serving story rather than distinguishing itself. Sufficient for the material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Limited spectacle—the budget shows in action sequences. The show's power is in intimacy: conversations at kitchen tables, confrontations in village squares, the domestic difficulty of having a dead child return. Spectacle is emotional rather than visual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Zombie as metaphor for mental illness, queerness, PTSD, the return of soldiers from war. The show explores rehabilitation, community acceptance, the failure of treatment, the humanity of the marginalized. The PDS sufferers are simultaneously victims and perpetrators—no one is simply good or evil. The density of meaning rewards attention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons of nine episodes. The first season focuses on Kieren's return; the second expands to the PDS community and the rising political tension. The pacing is deliberate—this is drama, not horror. The drive comes from character rather than plot: will Kieren be accepted? Will the village heal?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after two seasons, but the second season provides reasonable closure. Kieren finds acceptance; the village confronts its prejudice; the door remains open for continuation. The ending is open rather than incomplete. Frustrating cancellation, satisfying conclusion to what exists.</p>
