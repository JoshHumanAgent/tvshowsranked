            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>In the Flesh is a zombie show where the zombies are the victims. The Rising happened—dead people rose and attacked the living. But then a treatment was found. The zombies, now called Partially Deceased Syndrome (PDS) sufferers, can be medicated into consciousness. They remember everything they did. They have to go home and live among the people they tried to kill.</p>
            <p>Kieren Walker (Luke Newberry) is a PDS sufferer returning to his small village in northern England. He killed people during the Rising. He also killed himself before the Rising—he was gay, depressed, and rejected by his community. Now he's undead, medicated, remembering both his suicide and his murders, trying to reintegrate into a village that would rather see him dead again.</p>
            <p>His parents are trying to love him despite everything. His sister is in the Human Volunteer Force, the militia that fought the zombies and now patrols to make sure the "rotters" stay in line. His former friend Rick (David Walmsley) also died and came back, but Rick's father is a HVF leader who refuses to accept his son's condition.</p>
            <p>The show uses zombies as a metaphor for any marginalized group returning to a community that fears them. It's about reintegration, acceptance, the difficulty of being forgiven when you can't forgive yourself. Kieren is visibly different—his skin is pale, his eyes are contacts, he can't eat—but the real barrier is what he represents. The village fought a war against his kind, and now they're supposed to pretend it didn't happen.</p>
            <p>Nine episodes across two seasons. The BBC cancelled it too soon, but what exists is perfect—a complete story about prejudice, redemption, and the impossible task of going home after you've become something people fear.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Conceptual Density (9):</strong> Zombies as metaphor for marginalization—brilliant and politically sharp without being preachy. The PDS concept is fully developed.</p>
            <p><strong>Characters & Acting (9):</strong> Luke Newberry is heartbreaking as Kieren. The supporting cast captures small-town fear and prejudice with uncomfortable authenticity.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution (5):</strong> Cancelled after two short seasons. The story continues in implied ways, but we deserved more.</p>
