## What It Feels Like to Watch

Catherine Cawood is a police sergeant in West Yorkshire. Her grandson is being raised by her because her son (the boy's father) committed suicide. She's bitter, angry, and relentless in her job. Then the nephew of a local crime lord is found dead, and Catherine begins an investigation that will expose the dark heart of her community.

This is British crime drama at its finest. Sarah Lancashire is extraordinary as Catherine — she's not a hero, she's a survivor, and her anger is both justified and destructive. The show doesn't make her likeable; it makes her human.

The show has aired over nearly a decade, with long gaps between seasons, and it's been worth the wait. Each season builds on the last, deepening characters and raising stakes. The third season is a masterpiece.

James Norton is memorable as Tommy Lee Royce — the man responsible for Catherine's son's death, who is now out of prison and trying to rebuild his life. He's terrifying and sympathetic, often at the same time.

This is not fast-paced television — it's patient, character-driven drama that earns every emotional beat.
