            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Who drew the dicks? Twenty-seven faculty cars, spray-painted phalluses, and a school determined to find the culprit. Dylan Maxwell is accused; Peter and Sam, student documentarians, investigate. What begins as parody (Making a Murderer but crude drawings) becomes genuine mystery with genuine stakes. The second season tackles the Poopiter—the cafeteria lemonade contaminated with laxatives. Absurdist premise, serious investigation, surprisingly profound about teenage life.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Tyler Alvarez and Griffin Gluck as Peter and Sam are the heart: earnest documentarians who believe in truth. Jimmy Tatro as Dylan is perfect as the stoner accused—he's obnoxious, but is he guilty? The supporting cast creates a complete high school ecosystem. The performances are naturalistic; the mockumentary format demands it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>High school as crime scene: the social hierarchies, the faculty politics, the way accusation changes everything. The show captures teenage life with documentary accuracy—the Instagram posts, the party culture, the way truth gets buried under reputation. Recognizable and specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Mockumentary style perfected: talking heads, reenactments, drone footage, phone video. The show mimics true crime documentary aesthetics completely. The visual language reinforces the joke while supporting genuine investigation. Style as substance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle—this is students with cameras investigating petty crimes. The "spectacle" is the dedication to absurdity: detailed analysis of dick-drawing styles, laxative chromatography, the obsessive detail. Mock spectacle for mockumentary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The parody is the point, but the show becomes real: the cost of accusation, the failure of institutions, how truth becomes less important than narrative. Dylan may be guilty; the system that convicts him is definitely broken. The themes are sophisticated beneath the toilet humor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons of genuine mystery structure. Who drew the dicks? Who contaminated the lemonade? Each episode reveals evidence, complicates theories, ends with questions. The mockumentary format doesn't reduce the drive—the mysteries are real, the stakes feel real. Binge-worthy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, each with complete resolution. The mysteries are solved; the conclusions are satisfying and thematically appropriate. The show ends before the premise wears thin. Perfect mockumentary execution.</p>
