        <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
        <p class="vibe-text">
            Jessica Jones is a private investigator with super strength and PTSD. Kilgrave, the man who controlled her mind, is back. Krysten Ritter is Jessica—angry, damaged, drinking through the pain. David Tennant is Kilgrave—charming, terrifying, the abuser who won't let go. Melissa Rosenberg created Marvel's most adult offering: a superhero show about trauma, consent, and survival.

        <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

        <div class="dimension">
            <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
            <p>Krysten Ritter is perfect: the rage, the vulnerability, the strength that's both super and psychological. David Tennant as Kilgrave is among Marvel's best villains—charismatic, petty, terrifying in his entitlement. The supporting cast (Rachael Taylor, Carrie-Anne Moss, Mike Colter) creates a noir world in the Marvel universe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dimension">
            <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
            <p> Hell's Kitchen as noir landscape: the dive bars, the seedy apartments, theAlias Investigations office. The Marvel connections exist without dominating. The world is Jessica's psychological space rendered physical—dark, threatening, compromised.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dimension">
            <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
            <p>Noir aesthetics applied to superhero: shadows, neon, rain-slicked streets. The style distinguishes the show from other Marvel offerings. The color palette is purple (Kilgrave's signature) and black. The visual language serves the tone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dimension">
            <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
            <p>The spectacle is minimal: Jessica lifting things, Kilgrave's purple glow, occasional fights. This is character-driven noir with superpowers, not action showcase. The "spectacle" is psychological—watching Jessica confront her abuser.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dimension">
            <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
            <p>Consent, trauma, agency, the aftermath of abuse, whether victims are responsible for crimes committed under coercion. The show explores these with sophistication unusual for superhero media. Kilgrave represents every abuser who believes his desires justify control. Groundbreaking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dimension">
            <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
            <p>Season 1 is a masterpiece of momentum: Kilgrave's return, Jessica's investigation, the escalating confrontation. Seasons 2-3 are less focused but maintain character drive. The first season is among Marvel's best television.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dimension">
            <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
            <p>Three seasons, complete. Season 1 resolves the Kilgrave story definitively. Seasons 2-3 explore Jessica's past and her mother. The ending provides closure. Each season can stand somewhat independently.</p>
