            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs leads a team investigating crimes involving Navy and Marine Corps personnel. Mark Harmon's Gibbs is the ideal procedural lead: taciturn, competent, driven by rules he sometimes breaks. The most-watched drama on television for years, and the mothership of a franchise that includes NCIS: LA, NCIS: New Orleans, NCIS: Sydney.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Mark Harmon's Gibbs is procedural television's iconic lead: the head slap, the rules, the boat in the basement. Michael Weatherly, Pauley Perrette, David McCallum created characters that became institutions. The cast changed across seasons; the format endured. The performances serve the procedural perfectly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>NCIS headquarters, the squad room, Abby's lab, Ducky's autopsy. The world is functional—a setting for investigations. The military connection provides cases; the team provides chemistry. The world persists but doesn't develop.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Network procedural aesthetics: functional, efficient, designed for syndication rather than distinction. The style is invisible—this is television as product, not art. 22 seasons have looked roughly the same.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. Crime scenes, interrogations, lab results. The "spectacle" is the case resolved. This is procedural comfort food—predictable, satisfying, forgettable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Military justice, the families of service members, loyalty and rule-following. The themes are present but secondary to the case-of-the-week format. NCIS delivers procedural without ambition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Procedural momentum: each episode introduces a crime, investigates, resolves. The drive is relentless—22 episodes per season, formula executed with precision. The serialized arcs (Gibbs' past, team changes) provide continuity without requiring commitment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing after 20+ seasons. The show continues with rotating cast. The procedural format resists resolution—each season is more cases, more team changes. The show will continue as long as ratings permit.</p>
