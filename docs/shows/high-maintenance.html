            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The Guy delivers weed to New Yorkers. Each episode is about his clients—their lives, their problems, their loneliness. Ben Sinclair created and stars in the web-series-turned-HBO show. Not about cannabis, but about connection in the city. New York as mosaic.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Ben Sinclair as The Guy: the witness, the connection, the through-line. The guest stars create a rotating cast of New Yorkers. The performances are naturalistic—this feels like real people.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Brooklyn, Manhattan: the apartments, the neighborhoods, the subcultures. Each episode is a different world connected by The Guy. New York rendered with specificity and love.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production with indie aesthetics: handheld, observational, the city photographed in its variety. The style is invisible—we're watching lives, not a show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is lives lived: apartments, conversations, deliveries. The "spectacle" is the variety of human experience. Intimate portraiture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Loneliness, connection, how we survive the city, the transactions that aren't transactions, New York as character. The show explores urban existence through the weed delivery structure. Profoundly human.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic anthology: each episode is a different client's story. The Guy provides continuity but not drive. This is observation, not plot. The drive is curiosity about lives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons. The show ended without dramatic conclusion—it's a slice of life that stopped being sliced. The format resists traditional resolution. Complete in its own terms.</p>
