            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Hell's Kitchen at night. A blind lawyer who can't stop fighting for his city, even when the cost is everyone he loves. Wilson Fisk—Kingpin—elected mayor. The conflict is intimate: two men who know each other, who've destroyed each other, who can't escape their mutual orbit. Street-level Marvel with HBO ambitions: hallway fights, moral compromise, Catholic guilt, the impossibility of being a hero in a corrupt system.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock has perfected the role: the stillness of blindness, the violence of vigilantism, the conflict between lawyer and vigilante. Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin is Shakespearean—a monster in expensive suits, terrifying in controlled bursts. The returning cast (Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson) provides continuity. New additions maintain quality. Marvel's best casting remains this show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Hell's Kitchen as character: the alleys, the rooftops, the tenements, the courtrooms. The show creates a complete ecosystem: crime families, legal aid clinics, police corruption, political machinery. The Marvel Cinematic Universe connection is light enough to stand alone. This is street-level world-building—intimate rather than cosmic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The fight choreography is legendary: long takes, brutal impacts, clear geography. The show's hallway fight is iconic, but every action sequence is crafted with care. Night scenes in Hell's Kitchen create noir atmosphere. The visual language distinguishes it from every other Marvel production: darker, grainier, more visceral.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is physical: fights, falls, impacts. This isn't cosmic Marvel—no space battles, no alien invasions. The spectacle is in the choreography, the willingness to show violence and its consequences. The "Born Again" budget shows—more resources than the Netflix seasons, but the same commitment to grounded action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Catholic guilt, justice versus law, the cost of vigilantism, corruption in institutions. The show explores whether violence can ever be righteous, whether the system can work when it's rigged. Matt Murdock's confession scenes are television drama at its most explicitly theological. The themes are present, though sometimes secondary to action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show maintains momentum: Fisk's mayoral campaign, Matt's attempts to live without Daredevil, the inevitable collision. Each episode advances the central conflict while delivering standalone moments. The pacing balances procedural elements with serialized arc. Compulsive viewing for superhero fans.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Too early to judge resolution. The first season establishes the new status quo—Fisk in power, Matt struggling to resist the mask. The show's title suggests a multi-season arc. Potential is high; execution remains to be seen over time.</p>
