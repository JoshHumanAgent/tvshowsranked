            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The France tourists never see. Housing projects, police stations, courtrooms where justice is negotiated rather than delivered. A legal system that operates on deals and blackmail as much as evidence. Women in power—judges, lawyers, captains—fighting through institutions designed for men. It's The Wire if The Wire were French and focused on the intersection of policing and prosecution. Paris looks like what it is: beautiful and savage in equal measure.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Caroline Proust as Captain Laure Berthaud is one of television's great detectives—compulsive, brilliant, self-destructive, maternal toward her team and no one else. Grégory Fitoussi's prosecutor Pierre Clément is the moral center that erodes season by season. Thierry Godard as Gilou is the loyal fuckup who breaks your heart. The ensemble is deep, French-trained actors bringing theatrical intensity to genre television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The French legal system rendered comprehensible to outsiders: juges d'instruction (investigating judges), procureurs (prosecutors), avocats (defense attorneys), and the police who navigate between them. The banlieues, the courtrooms, the prisons—each location has its own rules, its own economy. This is institutional television that teaches while it entertains.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Canal+ budget means it looks better than American broadcast but short of HBO prestige. The Paris that appears is gray, institutional, lived-in. The style is functional—serving story rather than calling attention to itself. Night scenes in the projects have genuine danger; courtroom scenes have procedural clarity. Effective, not spectacular.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>This isn't spectacle TV. The spectacle is in the system revealed: how French justice actually functions, how power flows through institutions. The visuals serve the revelation, not the reverse. When violence occurs, it's shocking precisely because the show isn't about violence—it's about the machinery of justice that violence feeds.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The French system of investigating judges is unique—magistrates who both investigate and judge, creating conflicts of interest built into the system. Spiral explores institutional corruption not as exception but as norm. The law is not a refuge but a battlefield. These are sophisticated ideas delivered through propulsive storytelling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season-long cases with weekly complications. The structure is The Wire—a single investigation unfolding across episodes. But Spiral is less patient, accelerating toward resolutions that sometimes feel unearned. The momentum is strong but occasionally sacrifices depth for closure. Still, each season is designed to be consumed, and consume you it will.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight seasons with a planned conclusion. The final season brings everything full circle—careers ending, institutions continuing, personal costs finally tallied. The show understands that in police work, there are no victories, only survivors. The resolution honors that truth. Main characters die, retire, or continue broken. It's honest about the cost of the job.</p>
