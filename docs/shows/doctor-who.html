            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Being a child again, hiding behind the sofa while something impossible unfolds on screen. A blue box that's bigger on the inside. Running—always running—through corridors of starships, Victorian streets, alien planets. The terror of a monster in the dark, then the relief when someone clever figures out how to defeat it using nothing but wit and a screwdriver. It's wonder mixed with dread, comfort food television that somehow keeps reinventing itself across generations.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The Doctor is one of television's great characters—schizophrenic by design, each regeneration bringing a new personality while retaining the ancient soul of a Time Lord. From Eccleston's damaged war veteran to Tennant's manic depressive genius to Capaldi's crusty professorial grandeur, the role has attracted Britain's finest. Companions vary wildly in quality—from Martha Jones (excellent) to Clara Oswald (polarizing). The ensemble is inconsistent but the lead performance(s) carry immense weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Sixty years of accumulating mythology creates something unmatched in television. The Whoniverse includes Time Lords, Daleks, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, the Time War, Gallifrey, the Shadow Proclamation, UNIT, Torchwood—layers upon layers. The show can go anywhere in time and space, which means the world-building is literally infinite. The internal logic is wobbly, but the scope is undeniable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC budget constraints have always shown. The classic series looked like theater-in-the-round; the revival improved dramatically but still can't match prestige TV. Doctor Who gets by on imagination rather than polish. The best episodes direct around limitations; the worst expose them. When it works—"Blink," "Heaven Sent"—it's despite the visuals, not because of them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The TARDIS console room alone is worth points—a police box exterior hiding an infinite cathedral within. Alien planets, historical recreations, space stations, the TARDIS itself—the show creates spectacle through accumulation rather than budget. The Daleks remain iconic design. But rubber suits and obvious CGI are constant companions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Time travel done right: fixed points, paradoxes, bootstrap loops, the Blinovitch Limitation Effect. The show rewards thinking about temporal mechanics while also being silly enough to have a pirate ship on a spaceship. Deep cuts for dedicated fans ("The Day of the Doctor" callbacks), accessible enough for children. Steven Moffat's era especially layered meaning on meaning—sometimes to confusion, often to brilliance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>When Doctor Who works, it's among the most propulsive television ever made. "Just one more episode" was invented here. The anthology structure means stories reset every few episodes, but within those stories, momentum is everything. The best episodes—most written by Moffat—unfold like puzzles, each piece clicking into place until the final revelation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>How do you end a show that's designed to never end? Doctor Who cheats—regeneration allows reinvention. Individual eras conclude: Tennant's "I don't want to go" is devastating; Smith's "I will always remember when the Doctor was me" is beautiful. But the show itself is immortal, which is both strength and limitation. No final ending, no ultimate closure—just perpetual becoming.</p>
