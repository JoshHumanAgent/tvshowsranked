            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Howard Silk works at a UN agency in a low-level job. He doesn't know what his agency does. Then he learns: during the Cold War, a parallel dimension was discovered. Everyone has a counterpart over there. The two worlds are diverging. Howard meets his other self. J.K. Simmons plays both Howards—meek Howard Alpha and ruthless Howard Prime. The best dual performance on television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>J.K. Simmons is the show: two Howards with the same face, completely different personalities. The scenes where he talks to himself are masterclasses in performance. Olivia Williams, Harry Lloyd, Nazanin Boniadi provide the spy world. Simmons carries the show; the cast supports him perfectly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Two Berlins: one is our world, one diverged. The Interface, the Crossing, the espionage between worlds. The world is built with spy thriller precision—Cold War paranoia expanded to interdimensional scale.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz production: Berlin photographed in two versions, spy aesthetics, parallel worlds distinguished by subtle details. The style is Berlin spy thriller—grey, cold, precise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is espionage: meetings in cafés, crossings through checkpoints, conversations in offices. The "spectacle" is watching Howard meet Howard—the performance is the effect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Identity, whether we are our choices or our circumstances, the self as other, what we owe to our counterparts. The show explores the parallel world not as sci-fi but as philosophy: who would you be if things had been different?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Spy thriller pacing: assassinations, conspiracies, mole hunts. The drive is constant—Howard Alpha is drawn into Howard Prime's world. Each episode escalates the stakes. The genre hybrid (spy + sci-fi) creates momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled. The story continues in graphic novel form. The ending is incomplete but not unsatisfying—the character arcs are resolved even as the world conflict isn't. Deserves continuation.</p>
