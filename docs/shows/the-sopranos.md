## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Sopranos begins with a man in therapy. Not a war veteran, not a trauma victim—a mob boss. And that single image tells you everything. This is not a traditional crime drama. This is an exploration of the American condition, disguised as a mob story.

You watch Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) juggle the demands of his crime family with the demands of his actual family. He has panic attacks. He sees Dr. Melfi. He struggles with his mother—the most toxic woman in television history—and his wife, who knows exactly who he is but chooses to stay. His children are troubled in different ways. His crew is loyal and treacherous by turns.

What David Chase understood is that mobsters are just like everyone else—except their jobs involve murder. Tony goes to work, deals with difficult colleagues, has arguments with his spouse, worries about his kids. The mundane and the murderous coexist. That's what makes it terrifying.

Gandolfini's performance is legendary for good reason. He's terrifying and vulnerable, loving and cruel. You hate Tony Soprano, and you understand him. That's a dangerous combination.

The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Edie Falco as Carmela provides the moral center—even as she's complicit in everything. Michael Imperioli as Christopher Moltisanti shows the tragedy of a young man wanting to be a gangster. Tony Sirico is unforgettable as Paulie Gualtieri. The list goes on.

The production pioneered techniques we now take for granted—cold opens that subvert expectations, dream sequences that reveal character, literary references that reward careful viewers. The music choices are iconic. The New Jersey settings feel authentically suffocating.

The Sopranos ends with the most controversial finale in television history. Some hate it. Many have come to understand it. Either way, it proved that television could end on its own terms, not movie terms.

This is where prestige television began. Everything that came after owes something to The Sopranos.
