## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Sopranos killed the network sitcom and raised television to art. David Chase didn't just make a gangster show—he made a meditation on American decline disguised as crime fiction. Tony Soprano isn't just a mobster; he's the death of the American dream personified.

You spend six seasons in therapy sessions with the devil. You understand that evil can be banal and mundane and still terrifying. You watch a monster—and you can't look away.

The brilliance of The Sopranos is how it makes you complicit. You find yourself rooting for Tony, then catch yourself, then root for him again. The show never lets you off the hook. Each episode is structured like a tight thriller, with tension that builds and builds until you realize you've binge-watched three episodes without breathing.

The performances are legendary. James Gandolfini's transformation as Tony is remarkable—the way he carries himself, the charm, the violence, the vulnerability. Edie Falco as Carmela provides the moral center, even as she enables everything. Michael Imperioli as Christopher provides the emotional anchor—the young guy who wants to be a writer. The entire cast creates a world that feels utterly lived-in.

The cut to black. The most debated ending in television history. Did Tony die? Did the show end? Chase refused to answer, and in that refusal created something perfect—the uncertainty of life itself.
