            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">The O.C. was the teen drama of the early 2000s, a show that understood that teenagers could appreciate irony without sacrificing sincerity. Ryan Atwood is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks—Chino, specifically—who's adopted by a public defender and his wealthy Newport Beach family. What follows is four seasons of class conflict, teenage romance, and family drama, all set to an indie-rock soundtrack that introduced a generation to Death Cab for Cutie.</p>

            <p>The show's signature was its tone: self-aware enough to mock its own conventions, emotionally committed enough to make you care anyway. Adam Brody's Seth Cohen was the particular genius—a nerd who was funny because he knew he was a character in a teen drama, but whose vulnerability made the meta-commentary feel like defense mechanism rather than distance. The supporting cast created a Newport that was simultaneously fantasy and critique, where wealth was both attractive and corrosive.</p>

            <p>Where The O.C. struggled was in its later seasons, when the formula began to repeat and the graduation that should have ended the show instead led to college storylines that diluted what had made the series work. But at its peak—roughly the first season and a half—it was as good as teen drama gets, mixing soap opera plotting with genuine intelligence about class, family, and what happens when you bring someone from one world into another and expect them to adapt.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>The O.C. earns its ranking through its cultural impact, distinctive tone, and a first season that remains a template for how to do teen drama well. The score reflects a show that peaked early but maintained enough quality to be remembered fondly.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ben McKenzie's Ryan is the brooding center, Mischa Barton's Marissa is the troubled love interest, and Adam Brody's Seth is the comedic heart. The adults—Peter Gallagher and Kelly Rowan as the adoptive parents—give the teenage drama weight. The performances capture teen emotion without condescension.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Newport Beach becomes a fully realized fantasy of Orange County wealth—mansions, yacht clubs, elaborate parties that serve as backdrops for drama. But the show also captures the sterility beneath the surface, the way money can't buy happiness though it can rent distraction. The setting is both wish-fulfillment and critique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>2000s television aesthetic: bright lighting, attractive people in attractive locations, composition that serves storytelling without calling attention to itself. The show looks like what it is—a network teen drama that wants to feel slightly more sophisticated than its competition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is in the wealth—the houses, the cars, the parties—not in anything the production creates. This is interpersonal drama in luxurious settings, not action or effects. The visual appeal is lifestyle fantasy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show genuinely engages with class mobility—Ryan's adjustment to wealth is not smooth, and the show acknowledges that moving between worlds has costs. The family dynamics are treated seriously, with parents who are present and flawed. It's smarter than its soap-opera elements suggest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>At its peak, the plotting is addictive—will Ryan and Marissa work out, what disaster will the next party bring, can Seth manage to talk his way into and out of trouble. Later seasons repeat formulas and lose momentum, but the early episodes maintain impressive narrative energy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show continued past its natural endpoint, and the final season feels like an afterthought. The conclusion provides closure for some characters but lacks the energy of the beginning. The O.C. is remembered for its peak, not its landing.</p>
