            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A heist movie that refuses to end. The tension of the first twenty minutes of Heat stretched across fifty hours. You're inside the Royal Mint of Spain, watching the clock, counting the hostages, not knowing which "hostage" is actually in love with a robber. Every episode ends on a cliffhanger designed to make you hate yourself for having self-control. It's soap opera dressed as Prestige TV, but the dressing is so good you almost don't notice the melodrama underneath.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Professor is a genuine original—criminal mastermind who operates through anticipation rather than violence, a man whose weapon is his mind. Álvaro Morte plays him with nervous energy masking absolute control. The robbers—Tokyo, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, Oslo—are distinct archetypes elevated by committed performances. Berlin is especially magnetic: a monster you somehow root for. The hostages and inspectors add layers to an already crowded stage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The heist IS the world. The Royal Mint, then the Bank of Spain—these become pressure cookers with their own internal logic, hierarchies, rules. Outside, the police and public form a counter-world. But there's limited scope beyond the operation. This is a contained story, not an expansive universe. The "world" is psychological rather than geographical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix money shows. The red jumpsuits and Salvador Dalí masks became instant icons—visual shorthand for the series. Inside the Mint/Bank, the cinematography creates claustrophobia while maintaining visual interest. The split-screens, the slow-motion, the "Bella Ciao" sequences—it's stylish television that knows exactly what it wants to look like.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>This isn't about explosions or CGI—it's about tension made visible. The spectacle here is logistical: watching a plan come together or fall apart. The show creates spectacle through constraint, showing you one location for hours and making it fascinating. When spectacle arrives—the gold rain, the blimps, the escape attempts—it lands because it's earned.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The Professor's plans are intricate but not deep. The show isn't exploring themes so much as executing genre. Yes, there's class warfare (robbing the state), anti-establishment fervor, but these are decorations rather than substance. The conceptual hook is "heist that keeps going"—simple, effective, but not intellectually demanding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>This is the show's superpower. Every episode ends with a problem, a revelation, a reversal. The narrative engine never cools down. Netflix didn't invent binge-watching, but Money Heist perfected the "I'll watch just one more" compulsion. The structure is designed to be addictive, and it works. The only-shows that match this for pure momentum are Breaking Bad and early Game of Thrones.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Part 1 was supposed to be the whole story. The expansion diluted the tension. The ending works—they escape, the Professor wins, losses are mourned—but the journey became repetitive. What should've been two parts became five. The resolution is satisfying; the path there was padded. A tighter show would rank higher.</p>
