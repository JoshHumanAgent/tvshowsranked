            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Extrapolations is an anthology series that imagines the near future through the lens of climate change—each episode jumping forward in time to show a world increasingly shaped by environmental crisis. It's an ambitious premise that attracts an ambitious cast, with recognizable actors appearing across stories that range from intimate character pieces to global-scale dramas. The result is uneven, sometimes frustratingly so, but it's also one of the few shows willing to seriously engage with what climate change might actually mean for human life.</p>

            <p>The anthology format allows variety in tone and focus. One episode might follow a religious community dealing with rising waters; another might center on tech billionaires attempting to geoengineer the atmosphere; another might explore how climate migration reshapes politics and family. When it works, Extrapolations creates the specific feeling of fiction that's trying to imagine the unimaginable—not dystopia for entertainment's sake, but a genuine attempt to think through scenarios that are already becoming real.</p>

            <p>When it doesn't work, the show feels like prestige television going through the motions—the same emotional beats, the same moral clarity, the same faith that good actors and serious themes will automatically yield good drama. Some episodes are stronger than others, and the variance is significant. The connective tissue between episodes—a few recurring characters, references to shared events—never quite creates the sense of a unified world; it remains more an anthology than a series. But for viewers willing to accept the unevenness, Extrapolations offers something rare: television that treats climate change as a present reality rather than a distant threat.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Extrapolations ranks where it does because ambition and execution don't quite align. The premise is substantial, the cast is strong, and individual episodes offer genuine power. But the anthology format creates inconsistency, and some episodes lean into message over drama. The score reflects respect for what it attempts with recognition of its limitations.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The cast includes recognizable names giving committed performances—Meryl Streep, Edward Norton, and others appear across episodes, bringing weight to roles that might otherwise feel like message-delivery vehicles. The anthology structure means no character gets extensive development, but individual episodes are well-acted enough to create emotional connection within their runtime.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show's particular strength is imagining climate futures with plausible specificity. Each time jump brings new technologies, new politics, new normalizations of crisis. The production design shows restraint—this is the future, but not a radically transformed one; it's the present plus consequences. The world-building works because it feels like extrapolation rather than speculation.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach varies by episode—some are intimate and contained, others range across transformed landscapes. The future is rendered through production design and location choice as much as effects: buildings modified for new climates, cities reshaped by water, infrastructure designed for different conditions. It's effective without being showy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle here is environmental—flooded cities, burning forests, transformed landscapes. The effects are used sparingly to show climate impacts rather than to create action sequences. The scale is intentional: this is what the future looks like, not what the future looks like when it becomes a movie.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>This is the show's strongest dimension. Extrapolations engages seriously with what climate change means for politics, economics, religion, family, and individual psychology. The scenarios are recognizable extensions of current trends, and the show doesn't flinch from difficult questions about adaptation, mitigation, and the inequalities that shape who suffers first and most.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Anthology format means each episode must generate its own momentum, with variable success. Some episodes are propulsive; others feel like illustrated essays. The lack of connection between stories means you're not carried forward by investment in continuing characters—you start fresh each hour, which can be either liberating or exhausting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode resolves its own story, which provides closure but prevents the cumulative power of a unified narrative. Some endings are hopeful; others are devastating. The series as a whole offers no resolution because climate change offers no resolution—it's ongoing. This may be honest, but it's also unsatisfying for viewers seeking narrative completion.</p>
