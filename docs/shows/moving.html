            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Parents with superpowers hide their abilities. Their children inherit powers they don't understand. The parents were black ops agents; now they're being hunted. Park Hoon-jung adapts Kang Full's webtoon: Korean superhero drama as family story. The budget is massive, the emotion is real, the action is stunning.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Ryu Seung-ryong, Han Hyo-joo, Zo In-sung—the parents carry the past. The younger cast (Lee Jung-ha, Go Yoon-jung, Kim Do-hoon) brings the discovery. The performances ground the superpowers in family emotion. Korean drama acting at its finest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>South Korea's hidden super-powered: the black ops program, the retired agents, the children discovering abilities. The world expands across episodes—Korean intelligence, North Korean operatives, American involvement. Complete and specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Disney+ K-drama budget: the powers are rendered beautifully, the action is staged with precision, the emotional scenes are filmed with care. The style is Korean cinema elevated to television scale.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Superpowers: flight, regeneration, electrical control, super strength. The action sequences are stunning—the sky battle, the school fight, the apartment confrontation. Some of the best superhero action on television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Parental sacrifice, inherited trauma, whether we protect our children by hiding the truth or preparing them, government use of individuals. The show explores superhero tropes through Korean family dynamics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The past catches up: the parents' histories are revealed, the children's powers emerge, the hunters arrive. The structure moves between timelines—past and present weaving together. The pacing is masterful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The story resolves—past and present collide, protect and prepared converge. The ending provides closure while leaving room for future stories. Satisfying.</p>
