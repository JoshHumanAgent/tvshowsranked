## What It Feels Like to Watch

In 1958 New York, Miriam "Midge" Maisel is a housewife whose husband leaves her. In her grief, she discovers she's actually a talented stand-up comedian — and sets out to make it in a man's world.

This is Amy Sherman-Palladino's love letter to the golden age of comedy. The production is gorgeous: period-accurate costumes, detailed recreations of 1950s-60s New York, and a visual style that's lush and inviting.

Rachel Brosnahan is extraordinary as Midge — a woman who discovers herself through comedy while navigating the expectations placed on women in the 1950s. The supporting cast is excellent: Alex Borstein as Midge's manager Susie; Michael Zegen as her ex-husband Abe; and the always-wonderful Luke Kirby as Lenny Bruce.

The show is funny — it's about comedy, after all — but it's also about marriage, career, family, and the changing roles of women. It's never preachy, but it's quietly feminist.

The show ran for five seasons and ended on its own terms. It's a crowd-pleaser that also happens to be excellent.
