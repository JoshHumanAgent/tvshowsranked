## What It Feels Like to Watch

Charlie Brooker's *Black Mirror* is the defining anthology series of the streaming age. Each episode is a standalone story — a dark fable about technology, humanity, and the futures we might be building for ourselves.

The show takes its name from the black screens we all carry in our pockets. The mirror is the smartphone, the tablet, the smart TV. And what we see in that mirror isn't always pretty.

The first three seasons (aired on Channel 4 in the UK) are the most acclaimed. "The Entire History of You" asks what would happen if we could record and replay our memories. "White Bear" is a nightmare about punishment and surveillance. "White Christmas" is a Three-Stories-in-one anthology about consciousness and copy. These episodes are bleak, but they're also clever — Brooker uses speculative technology as a lens to examine contemporary anxieties.

Netflix acquired the show for seasons four through six, and the quality became more uneven. But there are still gems: "San Junipero" (a love story set in a simulation), "Nosedive" (about a society that rates everything), and "USS Callister" (a *Star Trek* parody that's also a horror story about video game developers).

The show has evolved. The recent seasons have become more explicitly satirical, less interested in subtle dystopia. But the core concept remains: technology amplifies who we are. It doesn't change us — it reveals us.

The episodes are best experienced without spoilers. Each one is designed to make you think, to make you uncomfortable, to make you wonder: could this happen? Is this already happening?
