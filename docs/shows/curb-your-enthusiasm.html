            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Larry David plays Larry David—a version of himself with no filter, no social grace, and endless capacity for creating problems from nothing. Each episode builds from a minor misunderstanding into catastrophic consequence. Improvised from outlines, the show captures the petty grievances of daily life and explodes them into comedy. The longest-running HBO comedy, and the purest expression of David's worldview.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Larry David is Larry David—no one else could be. Jeff Garlin as Jeff, Cheryl Hines as Cheryl (seasons 1-6), Susie Essman as Susie Greene (the screaming voice of social consequence) create the ecosystem of enablers. The guest stars (Ted Danson, Richard Lewis, JB Smoove) play versions of themselves. The performances are committed to the cringe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Los Angeles: the golf courses, the restaurants, the parties, the parking lots. The world is where social conventions exist to be violated. Each location is potential for disaster. The setting is the map of Larry's potential grievances.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Handheld, documentary-style: cameras follow Larry through his mistakes. The style serves the improv—nothing is staged too precisely, everything is captured. The aesthetic is invisible comedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people talking, people misunderstanding, people making situations worse. The "spectacle" is social disaster—watching Larry destroy himself through stubborn adherence to his principles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Social conventions, the lies we tell to lubricate interaction, the hypocrisy of niceness, whether honesty is actually virtuous. Larry is wrong and right simultaneously—he violates conventions, but the conventions are often absurd. The show is philosophy as cringe comedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode begins with a grievance and escalates. The structure is inevitable: Larry's principles lead to consequences that compound. The drive is watching the disaster build, then resolve (or not). The formula works for 24 years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Twelve seasons, complete. The final season provides the ending Seinfeld was denied—Larry experiences consequences. The show existed in seasons with gaps; the ending is the closing statement. Complete.</p>
