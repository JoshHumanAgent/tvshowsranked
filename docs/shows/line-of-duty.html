<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">AC-12 investigates police corruption. Each season targets a different suspect. The interviews are legendary—interrogation as combat. Jed Mercurio created British crime's most addictive procedural: who is "H"? The hunt for the corrupt officer at the top.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Adrian Dunbar as Ted Hastings: "Mother of God!" Martin Compston as Steve Arnott. Vicky McClure as Kate Fleming. The guest suspects (Lennie James, Keeley Hawes, Thandie Newton, Stephen Graham) bring the cases. The interview scenes are legendary.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>AC-12: the anti-corruption unit, the interview rooms, the surveillance. The world is police procedure—accurate, tense, bureaucratic.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>BBC production: the interview rooms, the surveillance, the shootouts. The style serves the tension—the interviews are static frames that explode.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is procedure: the interviews, the evidence, the revelations. The "spectacle" is the tension—watching someone break under questioning.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Corruption, loyalty to truth vs. loyalty to colleagues, institutional rot, the cost of investigation, what we sacrifice for justice. The show explores these through AC-12's work.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (10/10)</h3><p>Each season builds the case: surveillance, evidence, the interview. The structure is escalation—the tension is unbearable. Binge television designed for addiction.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Six seasons. The hunt for "H" provided serialized drive. The season 6 finale divided audiences—some found it satisfying, others disappointing. The journey is the point.</p></div></section>
