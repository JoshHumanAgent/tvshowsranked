            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Line of Duty is a British police drama about AC-12, the anti-corruption unit that investigates officers suspected of misconduct. Created by Jed Mercurio, the show established a pattern over six seasons: a high-ranking officer appears guilty, AC-12 investigates, loyalties are tested, conspiracies are uncovered, and the truth is complicated. The show built national suspense in Britain around the identity of "H," the corrupt officer seemingly directing corruption from high position.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes Line of Duty is its procedural rigor. Interrogation scenes are lengthy, technical, based on actual police protocols. The show respects both the institution and its corruption—it understands why good officers bend rules, why bad officers rise through ranks, how systems protect themselves. Martin Compston's Steve Arnott, Vicky McClure's Kate Fleming, and Adrian Dunbar's Ted Hastings form the core team, each damaged by the work of policing corruption within their own ranks.</p>

            <p>The show's greatest strength is guest stars—Thandie Newton, Keeley Hawes, Lennie James, Kelly Macdonald, Anna Maxwell Martin—playing suspects, victims, or perpetrators for single seasons. Each brings distinct energy to the procedural structure. The sixth season reached record viewership but provided resolution that disappointed some fans—a reminder that conspiracy reveals rarely satisfy the mystery that sustained them. Despite the ending, Line of Duty remains one of the most compulsively watchable British crime series of its era.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Line of Duty earns its ranking through procedural authenticity, guest performances, and sustained mystery over six seasons. The score reflects a show that became cultural phenomenon through quality craft.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The AC-12 trio anchors through multiple seasons. Adrian Dunbar's Ted Hastings became a national treasure—a principled but flawed man who says "Mother of God" at corruption. The rotating guest stars create fresh energy each season. Some villains become surprisingly sympathetic.</<p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>British police hierarchy is rendered with detailed attention: ranks, command structure, bureaucratic procedures that constrain heroism. The interrogation rooms, the offices, the streets all feel institutional and lived-in. The context supports the procedural.</<p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Functional television direction that serves the procedural without calling attention to itself. The interrogation scenes are staged to emphasize the psychological duels. This is craft rather than art.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>Minimal spectacle—shootouts, chases, violence are rare and realistically rendered. The spectacle is in performances, particularly the interrogation sequences. Visual interest is in faces and documents.</<p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores institutional corruption, loyalty versus integrity, and the difficulty of policing police. The questions are familiar but grounded in procedural details that make them specific. The "H" mystery sustained six seasons of speculation.</<p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The procedural structure creates constant momentum—episodes end with new evidence, new suspicions, escalations toward climax. The serialized mystery across seasons created appointment viewing in Britain. The pace is relentless without becoming exhausting.</<p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The sixth season's resolution of the "H" mystery disappointed fans who had speculated for years. The conspiracy resolution felt anticlimactic after such buildup. The show remains worth watching for the journey, but the destination didn't satisfy.</<p>
