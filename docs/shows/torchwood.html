            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Captain Jack Harkness leads Torchwood, a secret organization that investigates alien activity on Earth. It's Doctor Who for adults: darker, sexier, more violent. John Barrowman is Jack: immortal, omnisexual, charming. Russell T. Davies created the spinoff: what happens to the aliens the Doctor doesn't save?
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>John Barrowman as Captain Jack: the immortal leader with secrets. Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper: the audience surrogate. The Torchwood team creates a dysfunctional family. The performances embrace the darkness and the camp.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Cardiff as rift in space-time: aliens, artifacts, the secret base beneath the city. The world connects to Doctor Who while being distinctly adult. Torchwood exists in the Doctor's shadow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC Wales production: Cardiff photographed dark and alien, the base designed with style. The effects vary—BBC budget constrained sometimes—but the atmosphere delivers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Aliens, rifts, time travel, supernatural threats. The spectacle is BBC-budget sci-fi: enough to sell the concept, constrained compared to American productions. The ideas carry the effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Immortality as curse, what we sacrifice for safety, the government's response to threat, sexuality fluid as the universe. The show explores adult themes in the Who universe. Darker than its parent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic cases with serialized character development. Seasons 1-2 are case-of-the-week; Children of Earth (season 3) is serialized masterpiece; Miracle Day (season 4) is serialized misfire. Variable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons, effectively ended. Children of Earth is a perfect miniseries; Miracle Day couldn't match it. The show exists in Doctor Who's shadow, never quite escaping.</p>
