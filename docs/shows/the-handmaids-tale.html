            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>The Handmaid's Tale is dystopia as feminist horror. Gilead has replaced America—a theocratic regime where fertile women are enslaved as "handmaids," forced to bear children for the ruling class. Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is one such woman: her name means "of Fred," the Commander whose household she serves. "We were the people who were not in the papers," she narrates. "We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. We lived in the gaps between the stories." Margaret Atwood's novel becomes television—every trauma visualized, every cruelty made real.</p>
            <p>The show's thesis: it can happen here. Atwood wrote in the 1980s about a future where America becomes Gilead; the show, released in 2017, feels immediate. "Under His Eye," the handmaids say—the greeting, the surveillance, the constant reminder that they're watched. The ceremonies: the Commander raping Offred while his wife watches, the biblical justification for state-sanctioned violation. "Blessed be the fruit," the handmaids say. The fruit is stolen. The blessing is compulsion. The resistance is small, dangerous, often impossible.</p>
            <p>Season one adapts the novel—Offred's past in flashbacks, her present in Gilead, her eventual escape attempt. Season two expands: Offred/June's pregnancy, her capture, her return, her slow radicalization. Season three: June as resistance leader, the bombing of the Waterfords' trial at the end, the network of Marthas and handmaids working together. Season four: June in Canada, traumatized, hunting Gilead's commanders in exile. Season five: June versus Serena, survivor versus architect's wife. Season six announced as final.</p>
            <p>Six seasons, fifty-five episodes (projected complete). The Handmaid's Tale is difficult to watch—intentionally. Elisabeth Moss is extraordinary, her face showing everything June can't say. The production design: red cloaks, white bonnets, the color coding became protest symbols. "Nolite te bastardes carborundorum"—don't let the bastards grind you down. June doesn't. The show doesn't either. It's unflinching. It's also, after season one, sometimes excessive—cruelty piled on cruelty, hope dimmed and rekindled and dimmed again. But the first season is essential television. "We survived," June says. Surviving isn't triumph. It's just not dying.</p>

            <p><strong>Conceptual Density (8):</strong> Feminist dystopia. Theocracy as gender war. Every slogan became real-world protest sign.</p>
