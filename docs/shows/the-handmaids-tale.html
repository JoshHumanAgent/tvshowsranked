<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Gilead has replaced America. Women are property. Handmaids bear children for the ruling class. June Osborne fights to survive, then fights back. Margaret Atwood's novel adapted by Bruce Miller: dystopia as current horror, Elisabeth Moss as June—resistance in the darkest place.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Elisabeth Moss as June: the transformation from victim to resistance leader. Ann Dowd as Aunt Lydia: terrifying, complex. Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy: the true believer who doubts. The performances are Emmy-worthy across seasons.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>Gilead: the ceremony, the colonies, the households, the escape routes. The world is complete—Atwood's vision rendered with horrifying detail. Every rule has a purpose; every purpose is oppression.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>Hulu production: the grey and red palette, the oppressiveness made visual. The style is dystopian—the camera shows what totalitarianism looks like.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is horror: the ceremony, the punishments, the executions. The "spectacle" is the system—watching oppression made institutional.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3>
<p>Female autonomy, religious fundamentalism, resistance vs. survival, complicity, what we permit when it happens to others. The show explores Atwood's warnings made manifest.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Season 1: survive. Season 2: escape. Season 3: fight back. Later seasons: the fight continues. The structure evolves—June's journey from victim to warrior.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Ongoing. The show has continued past natural endpoints. Seasons 1-2 are essential; later seasons vary. The end is announced for upcoming seasons.</p></div></section>
