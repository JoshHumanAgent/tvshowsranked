<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A man is accused of murder. The evidence is overwhelming—including DNA. But he was somewhere else at the time—with witnesses. How can he be guilty? Ben Mendelsohn investigates; Cynthia Erivo is the private investigator who believes. Stephen King's novel adapted: procedural horror.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Ben Mendelsohn as Det. Ralph Anderson: the rationalist confronting the irrational. Cynthia Erivo as Holly Gibney: the investigator who senses what others don't. The performances ground the supernatural.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Small-town Oklahoma: the police station, the families, the evidence that doesn't make sense. The world is procedural—then the impossible enters.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>HBO production: the Oklahoma town, the forest, the creature glimpsed. The style is procedural horror—the supernatural emerges slowly.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the creature: glimpses, evidence, the terrible truth. The horror is in the procedural—the impossible in the mundane.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Rationalism vs. the irrational, how we explain the impossible, what happens when evidence contradicts itself. The show explores these through procedural horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>The evidence says guilty. The witnesses say innocent. How? The investigation reveals the impossible. The structure is procedural—clues, doubt, revelation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The creature is confronted; the case is resolved. The ending is satisfying procedural horror. HBO adaptation done right.</p></div></section>
