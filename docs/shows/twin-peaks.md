## What It Feels Like to Watch

In the small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, the body of Laura Palmer is found wrapped in plastic. FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper arrives to investigate, and what he finds is a town full of secrets, strange creatures, and coffee-obsessed locals.

This is the show that changed television. David Lynch created a series that defied every convention — a soap opera mixed with a crime drama, wrapped in surrealist nightmare logic. It's funny, scary, confusing, and profound, sometimes in the same scene.

The first season is near-perfect: eight episodes that introduced one of television's most memorable ensembles. Kyle MacLachlan is extraordinary as Agent Cooper — a man of rigid routine who finds himself drawn into the town's darkness. The cast includes Sheryl Lee (who played both Laura and her double Maddy), Lara Flynn Boyle as Donna, and the legendary performance by Michael Ontkean as Deputy Hawk.

The second season is more uneven, with Lynch's attention divided between the main story and his film work. But when it's good — particularly the finale — it's transcendent.

The original series was canceled after two seasons, but it spawned a film (*Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me*) and the 2017 revival (*Twin Peaks: The Return*). It's essential viewing for anyone who loves television that takes risks.
