<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Ten years after Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan has become "Ben": hiding in a cave, working at the meat factory, watching over Luke from orbit. When Leia is kidnapped, Bail Organa drags Ben back into the war. Obi-Wan Kenobi is Ewan McGregor's return to the character Disney paid him enough to play. The show answers questions nobody asked ("What if Obi-Wan fought Vader again?") while delivering what everyone wanted: Ewan's face, Hayden's Vader, a tiny glimmer of hope in the dark period between trilogies. The Leia-Kenobi relationship is the show's heart—the young princess who will be General Organa learning from her father's friend.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Ewan McGregor slips back into Kenobi seamlessly—broken, weary, still good. Hayden Christensen's Vader (through suit and as Anakin flashbacks) gives depth to the icon. Vivien Lyra Blair's young Leia is smart, stubborn, and recognizable. Moses Ingram's Reva has a decent arc from villain to redemption; the performance earned her hate mail from racists, which is never deserved. James Earl Jones' voice, synthesized for the first time, creates uncanny valley.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>Tatooine is familiar—this time showing the mundane horror of living under Empire. The Inquisitors' world expands Star Wars villainy. The flashbacks to Anakin and Obi-Wan's friendship are the show's gift. Imperial infrastructure (checkpoints, bounty hunters) is standard but effective.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6.5/10)</h3><p>Television Star Wars: competent, not cinematic. The Vader-Kenobi rematch has impact but looks small. Tatooine looks like Tatooine. It's Disney+ Star Wars—not the prequels' operatic scale, not Rogue One's grit.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>The Vader fight is obligatory but doesn't transcend. Third Sister's finale confrontation works. The show is built on McGregor's face more than effects. Fans waited years for this—spectacle wasn't the point; presence was.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Failure and hiding. Kenobi failed Anakin, failed the galaxy, failed himself. Watching him choose to emerge is the story. The show wants to be about trauma but keeps defaulting to Star Wars plot. The best moments are emotional, not thematic.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>The rescue Leia plot propels; the reunion with Vader provides climax. Six episodes means no fat. The pacing is designed for binge: every episode ends on urgency. The show moves steadily toward inevitable confrontation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3><p>Complete limited series—Leia rescued, Vader confronted, Ben returns to watching Luke. The resolution exists to fill canon gaps ("Why didn't Obi-Wan kill Vader?" Answer: tried, couldn't). It answers its premise adequately if not brilliantly.</p></div></section>
