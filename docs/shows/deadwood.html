            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1876 Deadwood, South Dakota. A lawless gold mining camp where civilization is being born. Al Swearengen runs the Gem Saloon. Seth Bullock tries to bring order. David Milch created Shakespeare in the mud: Shakespearean profanity, capitalist creation, the American West before it was tamed.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Ian McShane as Al Swearengen: television's greatest villain-protagonist, profane and profound. Timothy Olyphant as Seth Bullock: the lawman trying to contain his violence. The ensemble (Molly Parker, John Hawkes, Robin Weigert, Brad Dourif) is HBO's deepest. Milch's dialogue requires the best.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Deadwood 1876: the Gem Saloon, the hardware store, the tents becoming buildings, the camp becoming town. The world is complete—this is civilization emerging from chaos. The historical detail is immersive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production: the mud, the lanterns, the period rendered with reality. The style is observational—the camera watches civilization form. The aesthetic is anti-Western romanticism.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is mud and blood: the camp, the violence, the gradual emergence of order. The "spectacle" is language—the profanity as poetry. Character drama in period dirt.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Civilization from chaos, capitalism as creation, whether order requires violence, what we owe to community vs. self-interest. The show explores the American founding. Profound.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Camp politics: Swearengen's maneuvering, Bullock's law, Hearst's arrival. The structure is community formation—episodes are acts in civilization's birth. The drive is political.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, cancelled. The 2019 movie provided closure. The series ended incomplete; the movie added a coda. What exists is among television's best. The movie completes what cancellation denied.</p>
