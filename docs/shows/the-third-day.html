            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A man drives onto Osea Island and can't leave. The residents welcome him, but their rituals are ancient, their intentions unclear. Jude Law is Sam, escaping tragedy, drawn into something he doesn't understand. Then Helen (Naomie Harris) arrives with her daughters, also trapped. Two timelines, one island, the old ways persisting beneath modern surface. Folk horror elevated by HBO production values: The Wicker Man meets contemporary despair.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jude Law in part one ("Summer") is a man unravelling—grief made manifest. Naomie Harris in part two ("Winter") provides necessary counterpoint, protective mother against island darkness. The residents, led by Katherine Waterston and Paddy Considine, are appropriately ambiguous. The child actors are remarkable. The performances sell the premise: real people in impossible situation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Osea Island as character: the causeway that floods, the village pub, the ancient trees, the modern roads leading to primitive rituals. The show creates a complete community with beliefs, hierarchies, and customs that feel genuinely old. The world is both specific (this island) and archetypal (the isolated community with terrible secrets).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The island is photographed as dream: mist, water, isolation, the beauty that conceals danger. The final episode ("Autumn") was broadcast live, a 12-hour continuous shot following Sam's final day. The visual ambition matches the thematic ambition. Among TV's most distinctive looking shows.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is ritual and landscape: processions, bonfires, the causeway, the trees. The live episode is a television experiment unlike anything before. The horror is atmospheric rather than visceral—this is dread, not jump scares. Spectacle of mood.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Faith and ritual, grief and sacrifice, the persistence of old ways in modern minds. The show explores how belief systems create meaning and demand terrible things. The "third day" is resurrection mythology inverted. Dense with symbolism, demanding interpretation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two three-part stories: Sam's arrival and unraveling, Helen's arrival and confrontation. The structure creates dual perspective—outsiders encountering the same community. The pacing is deliberate; the horror accumulates rather than erupts. The "Autumn" live episode is unique in television history. Not for impatient viewers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Six episodes, two connected stories, resolution that's ambiguous by design. The live episode provides Sam's ending; Helen's confrontation provides closure for "Winter." The show resists straightforward interpretation. Complete, but not easily satisfied.</p>
