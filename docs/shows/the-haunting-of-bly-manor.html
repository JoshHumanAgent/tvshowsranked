<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">An au pair goes to Bly Manor to care for two orphans. There are ghosts. But this is also a love story. Mike Flanagan adapts Henry James: romantic horror, the Turn of the Screw expanded, love and loss in a haunted house.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Victoria Pedretti as Dani: the au pair with secrets. The supporting cast creates the Bly household. The ghost of the lady in the lake gives the horror. The performances capture both romance and dread.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Bly Manor: the house, the lake, the ghosts, the history. The world is layered—past and present ghosts coexist. The manor is wound and healing.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: English manor photographed for gothic romance. The style is warmer than Hill House—this is love story as much as horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the ghosts: the lady in the lake, the faceless children, the hidden presences. The horror is patient—revealed through story.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Love and loss, what we hold onto after death, whether ghosts are the dead or our memories, the cost of holding on. The show explores romance through haunting.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Dani arrives, falls in love, discovers the ghosts. The structure is slower than Hill House—romance requires patience. The drive is revelation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The love story resolves; the haunting resolves. The ending is romantic tragedy. Beautiful but gentler than Hill House.</p></div></section>
