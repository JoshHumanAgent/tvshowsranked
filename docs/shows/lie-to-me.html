            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Dr. Cal Lightman can read lies in facial expressions and body language. He's based on Paul Ekman, the real psychologist who studied microexpressions. Tim Roth is Lightman: British, abrasive, impossible to lie to. He runs a consultancy that helps law enforcement, corporations, and governments detect deception. The premise is House meets detective: the genius who sees what others miss.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Tim Roth is the show: the arrogance, the brilliance, the willingness to be disliked. Kelli Williams as Gillian provides the emotional intelligence. Brendan Hines and Monica Raymund round out the team. Roth makes Lightman watchable despite the character's abrasiveness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The Lightman Group: the office, the clients, the cases. The world is functional—a setting for the lie-detection premise. The science (microexpressions) is real enough to be interesting; the application (solving every case) is television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Network procedural aesthetics: functional, bright, focused on faces. The visual language serves the premise—close-ups of expressions, replays revealing the lie. The style is invisible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people talking, faces examined, lies detected. The "spectacle" is the reveal—watching Lightman break down what the audience missed. Intellectual detective work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Truth and lies, what we hide, whether deception is natural, the ethics of reading people without consent. The show touches on themes but prioritizes the procedural. The science is real; the application is fantasy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic cases with serialized character development: Lightman's past, his daughter, his relationship with Gillian. The structure is procedural—case solved, lesson learned, next case. The premise sustains momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after three seasons. The show was building toward character reveals that didn't fully materialize. The cancellation left arcs incomplete. What exists is entertaining but unfinished.</p>
