<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Nick and Charlie are British schoolboys who fall in love. That's it. That's the plot. Alice Oseman adapts her graphic novel: queer joy, first love, friendship. The show that made people believe in romance again.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Kit Connor as Nick: the popular boy who figures out he's bi. Joe Locke as Charlie: the out boy with anxiety. The ensemble creates the friend group. The performances capture teen authenticity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>British secondary school: the forms, the rugby, the friendships, the coming out. The world is school as both prison and possibility. Truham Grammar for love.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: the animation style from the graphic novel, the softness, the leaves floating when Nick falls for Charlie. The style is gentle—this is romance without harshness.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is teen romance: school, friends, first love. The "spectacle" is emotional—the joy of being seen, the safety of love.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Coming out, first love, friendship, mental health, queer joy. The show explores these through gentle romance. There's no trauma—only love.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Will they get together? They do. Will they stay together? The structure is romance—the drive is relationship. Each season develops the relationships.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Ongoing. Three seasons complete; more planned. The story continues. The romance is the point—there's no endpoint except love.</p></div></section>
