            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1934 Dust Bowl. Ben Hawkins joins a traveling carnival; he has healing powers he doesn't understand. Brother Justin is a preacher in California; he has visions he can't control. Their paths will converge. Daniel Knauf created HBO's strangest epic: biblical mythology, good vs. evil, carnies vs. preachers, all rendered in Depression-era America. The most literary show HBO ever made—and one of the most cancelled.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Nick Stahl as Ben is the reluctant messiah. Clancy Brown as Brother Justin is terrifying—evil masquerading as piety. The carnie ensemble (Michael J. Anderson, Adrienne Barbeau, Debra Christofferson) is a gallery of freaks and saints. The performances match the mythological weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>1934 America: the Dust Bowl, the carnival, the tent shows, the roadside encampments. Every detail is researched—this is historical fiction with supernatural overlay. The mythology (Avatars, the fight between Light and Dark) is developed across hours. The world is complete and unique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production at its most atmospheric: dust storms, carnival lights, California sunshine, the darkness inside Brother Justin. The photography is consciously painterly—American gothic rendered in light and shadow. Every frame could be a photograph.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the carnival itself, the revivals, the Dust Bowl exodus. Supernatural elements are presented with restraint—this is magical realism, not fantasy. The spectacle is in the world, not the effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Biblical mythology, the problem of evil, whether destiny can be escaped, the role of the avatar in human history. The show demands literacy—the references are to Revelation, to Jewish mysticism, to American folklore. The density is both strength and liability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two timelines: Ben and the carnival, Brother Justin and his congregation. The parallels accumulate; the convergence is promised. The pacing is deliberate—this is novel, not TV. Some find it slow; the patient are rewarded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after two seasons. Knauf had six seasons planned; we got the first act. The story stops mid-mythology. What exists is extraordinary; the incompleteness is devastating. Cult status is justified.</p>
