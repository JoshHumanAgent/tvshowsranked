            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Ordinary people discovering extraordinary abilities. A cheerleader who can't be hurt. A office worker who can fly. A painter who sees the future. A villain who collects powers by removing brains. The first season was lightning in a bottle—comic book storytelling translated to television with genuine tension and stakes. "Save the cheerleader, save the world" entered cultural memory. Then the writers' strike happened, and the magic scattered.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1's ensemble is remarkably balanced: Hayden Panettiere's indestructible cheerleader, Masi Oka's time-stopping Hiro, Milo Ventimiglia's empathetic Peter, Zachary Quinto's terrifying Sylar. Jack Coleman as Noah Bennet (HRG) is the moral center—ambiguous, dangerous, paternal. Acting varies; Quinto and Coleman are superb, others are adequate. The character web is intricate and satisfying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season creates a complete superhero mythology: genetic mutations, a company monitoring them, a future explosion that must be prevented, a virus that could wipe out humanity. The world expands organically—each answer leads to new questions. The graphic novel interludes and web presence added depth. Post-season 1, world-building collapses under its own weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Network television in 2006: competent but not distinctive. The visual style serves the story—powers are represented clearly, action beats are staged coherently. The Tokyo sequences have genuine visual interest. The future visions are rendered with appropriate dread. Functional filmmaking elevated by conceptual imagination.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>For network television in 2006, impressive. Hiro stopping time, Claire regenerating, Peter in freefall—the powers are realized with commitment. The budget constraints show compared to modern superhero content, but the show works within limitations. Spectacle serves story rather than overwhelming it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 is a masterclass in serialized storytelling: multiple timelines, converging storylines, destinies intersecting. The show borrows from comic storytelling techniques—cliffhangers, reveals, "issues" as episodes—and translates them successfully. The density is remarkable; rewatches reveal new connections. Post-season 1, the show loses focus.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 is propulsive: every episode ends with a revelation, a power discovery, a death. The narrative engine is "how do these characters meet?"—and each convergence delivers satisfaction. The drive diminishes in later seasons as the show chases formula over invention. But that first season is among television's tightest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 resolves beautifully; everything after struggles. The writers' strike truncated season 2; seasons 3-4 try increasingly desperate reinventions. The show forgot what made it work: ordinary people with extraordinary abilities, not superheroes with soap opera problems. The ending brings closure but not redemption for a show that lost its way.</p>
