            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1845. Two British ships, Erebus and Terror, search for the Northwest Passage. They become trapped in the ice. Something is hunting them. The cold, the starvation, the madness—and something supernatural. Dan Simmons's novel adapted: historical horror, the doomed Franklin expedition.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Jared Harris as Captain Crozier: the alcoholic realizing the end. Tobias Menzies as Captain Fitzjames. Ciarán Hinds, Paul Ready, Adam Nagaitis—the crew facing doom. The performances are survival horror at its finest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>The ships, the ice, the cold, the darkness. The world is 1845 Arctic—claustrophobic ships, endless ice, the Tuunbaq hunting them. The environment is character. The detail is historical and atmospheric.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>AMC production: the ice rendered with brutal beauty, the darkness, the ships claustrophobic. The style is survival horror—the cold is visual. Feature-quality television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the ice and the monster: the cold, the ships trapped, the Tuunbaq (the creature hunting them). The horror is atmospheric—the spectacle is the setting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Survival, empire's hubris, the colonial encounter, whether nature can be conquered, what happens when civilization faces the wild. The show explores these through historical horror.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The ships trapped, the cold killing, the monster hunting. Each episode is survival—rations, mutiny, madness. The structure is countdown. The drive is relentless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 is complete horror masterpiece. Season 2 (Infamy) is Japanese internment horror—related in theme, separate in story. Season 1 is one of television's great horror seasons.</p>
