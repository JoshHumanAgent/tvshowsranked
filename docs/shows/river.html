            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>River is a British detective series with a premise that shouldn't work but does entirely. John River (Stellan Skarsgård) is a detective who sees dead people—not in a haunted house way, but in a trauma-made-flesh way. His partner Stevie (Nicola Walker) was murdered, and he sees her constantly, talking to her, laughing with her, trying to solve her murder while his mind reconstructs her from grief and memory.</p>
            <p>The show is a police procedural that becomes a meditation on love, loss, and the people we carry inside us. River sees not just Stevie but other victims whose cases haunt him. These aren't ghosts in the supernatural sense—they're manifestations of his damaged mind, projections that help him process information even as they signal how broken he is. His colleagues think he's unstable. He knows he's unstable. He's also the best detective on the force.</p>
            <p>Stellan Skarsgård gives one of television's great performances. River is Norwegian, working in London, constantly slightly off-balance from cultural displacement and mental illness. He lumbers through cases with disheveled intensity, talking to people nobody else can see, and Skarsgård makes this feel neither crazy nor supernatural but profoundly human. The show treats mental illness not as quirk or deficit but as a particular way of being in the world.</p>
            <p>Nicola Walker as Stevie is the show's other miracle. She's dead from the first frame, but she's more alive than most characters in most shows. Her scenes with River reveal their partnership through flashback and hallucination—the jokes, the tenderness, the frustration. Their relationship becomes clearer as the show progresses, even though it ended before the show began.</p>
            <p>Six episodes, one complete story. The case is solved, the killer is found, and the ending doesn't fix anything but allows survival. River's grief doesn't end because grief doesn't end. He just learns to live with his ghosts a little better.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Characters & Acting (10):</strong> Stellan Skarsgård is devastating. Nicola Walker matches him despite being dead the entire show. One of the great acting showcases in television.</p>
            <p><strong>Conceptual Density (8):</strong> The premise—detective sees murder victims—could have been gimmicky. Instead it becomes profound, a study in trauma and memory.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution (8):</strong> Six episodes, complete story. The killer is found. River's grief isn't resolved—it couldn't be—but he's able to continue.</p>
