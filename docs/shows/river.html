            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Detective John River sees the dead. Not ghosts—manifestations of his grief, the people he couldn't save standing beside him as he works cases. His partner is murdered; she appears beside him, chattering, helping, driving him toward the truth. Stellan Skarsgård is the detective unraveling, solving crimes while his mind fractures. This is British crime drama as psychological exploration: the case matters less than the detective, the detective is breaking, the breaking is the story.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Stellan Skarsgård gives a performance of remarkable control—River's brilliance and his instability, his love for his partner and his inability to accept her death. Nicola Walker as the dead partner Stevie is luminous: we see her only through River's memory, but she's fully alive. The supporting cast creates a complete London police ecosystem. This is acting as character study.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>London as police procedural space: offices, council estates, interrogation rooms. The world is functional rather than distinctive. What makes it work is the psychological layer—River's manifestations overlay the physical world, creating a double vision that the show sustains throughout.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual style communicates River's condition: the dead appear without fanfare, integrated into scenes as if present. The camera treats them as real because River treats them as real. London is rendered in muted tones—grief colors everything. The style serves the psychological material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is one man's psychological disintegration, rendered through crime procedural. The "special effects" are the manifestations who appear and disappear, but they're treated as character rather than spectacle. Television as therapy session.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, trauma, the mind's response to unbearable loss. The show explores the line between mental illness and coping mechanism—River's manifestations help him solve cases, but they also isolate him. The question isn't whether he's crazy; it's whether his craziness serves him. Sophisticated psychology in genre clothing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Six episodes of investigation and disintegration. The murder of Stevie provides the case; River's condition provides the tension. The drive is dual: solve the murder, survive the grief. The structure allows both procedural satisfaction and psychological depth. Short and complete.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries with devastating resolution. The truth about Stevie's death emerges; River must accept her absence to survive. The final scene—a bus stop, a farewell, an acceptance—is among television's most affecting endings. Grief acknowledged, loss accepted, life continuing. Perfect.</p>
