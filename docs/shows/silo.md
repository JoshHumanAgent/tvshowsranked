## What It Feels Like to Watch

Silo is a dystopian sci-fi drama based on Hugh Howey's Wool novels. In a future where the outside world is toxic and deadly, humanity survives in a massive silo underground. But what looks like salvation might be the ultimate prison.

You watch Silo and feel the claustrophobia and mystery. Why are they really in the silo? What happened to the outside world? Who controls their lives? The show layers answers and questions masterfully.

The world-building is exceptional. The silo is a self-contained universe with its own rules, hierarchy, and secrets. Every level has its own character, its own power structure.

The performances are strong, particularly Rebecca Ferguson as the silo sheriff. She's smart, determined, and dangerous—exactly what a mystery needs.
