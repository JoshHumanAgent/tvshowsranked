            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Woo Young-woo is a lawyer with autism spectrum disorder and a genius for finding novel legal arguments. She graduated top of her class; she struggles with eye contact and social cues. Each case is a puzzle she solves differently than anyone else. The show is K-drama at its warmest: courtroom scenes mixed with duck-themed animation, a romance that respects difference, and a protagonist whose neurodivergence is her strength. A global phenomenon for a reason.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p> Park Eun-bin's performance is the show: precise, detailed, respectful, never condescending. The supporting cast—Kang Tae-oh as the love interest, Kang Ki-young as the supportive colleague—creates a firm that believes in her. The clients each episode provide emotional weight. The performances are K-drama earnest at its best.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Seoul law firm, courtroom, home with her single father. The world is functional, serving the cases rather than developing independently. The legal world is rendered somewhat idealistically—this is feel-good television, not The Good Wife.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama polish: the law firm looks expensive, the courtrooms look official, the streets of Seoul provide background. The animated sequences (whales swimming when Young-woo has breakthroughs) are charming. The visual style supports the emotional tone without calling attention to itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. The "spectacle" is Young-woo's legal reasoning, the breakthrough moments when she connects disparate concepts. The whale animations provide visual poetry. Otherwise this is lawyers in rooms.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Neurodivergence as strength, acceptance, the value of different perspectives. The show explores autism without defining the protagonist by it—Young-woo is a lawyer who happens to be autistic, not an autistic lawyer. The themes are handled with warmth; the education is gentle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic cases with serialized character arcs. Each episode presents a legal problem Young-woo solves uniquely; the season builds toward her relationship development and her father's story. The structure is K-doma classic: problem, solution, emotional reward. Highly bingeable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The first season provides satisfying closure for many arcs; the second season continues. The trajectory suggests more seasons. Currently delivering quality with open ending.</p>
