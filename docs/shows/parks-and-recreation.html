<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Leslie Knope works in the Pawnee Parks Department. She loves her town too much. Her coworkers are various levels of cynical. Greg Daniels and Michael Schur created the anti-cynicism comedy: government work made noble, friendship made essential.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Amy Poehler as Leslie: relentless optimism. Adam Scott as Ben: the straight man won over. Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson: libertarian made lovable. Aziz Ansari, Rashida Jones, Chris Pratt, Aubrey Plaza. Perfect ensemble.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Pawnee, Indiana: the town, the government, the citizens, the history. The world is built through mockumentary detail—every town has its lore.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>Mockumentary style inherited from The Office: talking heads, handheld. Functional comedy direction.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is local government work. The "spectacle" is enthusiasm.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Public service, friendship, optimism vs. cynicism, local government. The themes are explored through relentless positivity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Leslie's projects and career; relationships developing. The structure evolves from episodic to serialized—the show found its voice in season 2.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Seven seasons, complete. The flash-forward finale is perfect. Every character gets their ending. A model sitcom conclusion.</p></div></section>
