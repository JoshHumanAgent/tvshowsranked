            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Yeon Si-eun is physically weak, academically brilliant, and absolutely unwilling to be bullied. He uses physics, psychology, and improvised weapons to fight back against the school's violent hierarchy. Park Ji-hoon is mesmerizing as the boy who refuses to lose—not despite his weakness, but by understanding it deeply. Korean high school drama turned into tactical warfare. The fights are brutal, the alliances fragile, the hierarchy unrelenting.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Park Ji-hoon as Si-eun transforms from idol image to intense presence—quiet, fierce, damaged. The supporting cast (Choi Hyun-wook, Hong Kyung) as friends and rivals creates a complete social ecosystem. The bullies are specific, not stereotypes. Every fight reveals character through technique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Korean high school as combat zone: classrooms, rooftops, convenience stores as battlefields. The hierarchy is explicit—money, violence, connections determine position. Teachers are absent or complicit; the students govern themselves through force. Specific, claustrophobic, credible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The fight choreography is exceptional: clear geography, innovative techniques, visible consequences. Si-eun's strategies are filmed to show his thinking—improvised weapons, environmental advantages, psychological warfare. The style is Korean action cinema applied to television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The fights are the spectacle: brutal, tactical, consequential. Blood flows, bones break, the weak win through intelligence. The show doesn't romanticize violence—it shows cost. But the choreography is impressive, the tactics fascinating, the underdog victories satisfying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Strength vs. intelligence, the cost of resistance, the meaning of friendship when the world is hostile. The show explores how far someone will go to maintain dignity. The themes are present but secondary to the action beats. Character drama punctuated by violence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Relentless. Each episode brings new threat, new strategy, new alliance or betrayal. The hierarchy provides structure—Si-eun fights his way up. The pacing is aggressive; the tension never releases. Binge television at its most compulsive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The first season ends with partial resolution but open threads. The second season continues the story. Whether the complete arc will satisfy depends on future seasons. Currently delivering quality; ending unknown.</p>
