<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Harry Bosch retires from LAPD and becomes a private investigator, daughter Maddie joins the police force, and half-brother Mickey Haller (Lincoln Lawyer) navigates cases from the backseat of a Town Car. Bosch: Legacy continues Michael Connelly's universe with the same procedural precision but new pressures: Bosch now bills by the hour, Haller's courtroom drama intersects detective work, and Maddie brings rookie perspective to the family trade. This is LA noir without the noir—sunlit procedural with characters who've lived enough to carry baggage across seasons.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3><p>Titus Welliver is Bosch: weathered, principled, relentless. He's lived in this character so long the performance is muscle memory. Madison Lintz has grown as Maddie—competent, inheriting Bosch's doggedness. Mimi Rogers provides corporate intrigue. The cast knows exactly what show they're in.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>LA procedural infrastructure: private investigation, LAPD politics, courtroom dynamics, family entanglements. The cases have Connelly's legal precision—procedures feel researched. The city is present: Hollywood Hills, downtown court, valley heat.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>Competent procedural coverage. LA looks LA—the hills, the sprawl, the light. Nothing distinctive, but nothing wrong. The courtroom and investigation spaces feel authentic.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>Zero spectacle. This is people talking: in offices, in cars, in courtrooms. The drama is procedural: who did what, what evidence proves it, how the law resolves it. If you need action, skip.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Justice as process. Retirement as lost identity. Family legacy (both Bosch and Maddie). Private investigation versus police work. The themes are procedural genre conventions executed professionally.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3><p>Multiple cases across timelines. Each episode advances investigation, courtroom, and personal plot. The procedural engine keeps momentum. Connelly's plotting is professional: clues matter, payoffs land, threads connect.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Ongoing series. Each season resolves main cases while setting up next season's hooks. The family dynamics (Bosch and Maddie, Bosch and Haller) develop across episodes. You watch for the cases and return for the characters.</p></div></section>
