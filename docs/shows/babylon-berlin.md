## What It Feels Like to Watch

Babylon Berlin is a German production that rivals the most ambitious HBO dramas—but with a distinctly European sensibility. Set in Weimar Germany during the late 1920s and early 1930s, it drops you into a Berlin seething with political tension, artistic ferment, and criminal underworld activity.

You follow Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), a police detective transferred from Cologne to Berlin to investigate a case that pulls him into the city's depths. What he finds is a city on the edge—communists, Nazis, industrialists, and criminals all circling each other, waiting for the moment to strike.

The production values are extraordinary. This is the most expensive German TV series ever made, and it shows. Every frame looks like a painting. The attention to period detail is meticulous—the cars, the clothes, the sets, the technology. You believe you're in 1920s Berlin.

But it's not just pretty. The writing weaves multiple storylines—a noir mystery, a political thriller, a social drama—into a tapestry that reveals the rot beneath the glamour of the Weimar Republic. The series is critical of the forces that would destroy it from within while celebrating the art and culture it produced.

Liv Lisa Fries as Charlotte Ritter provides the audience surrogate—a young woman navigating Berlin's strict class system, working as a secretary by day and infiltrating the underground scene by night. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent.

Babylon Berlin proves that German television can match international standards while telling stories unique to its history. It's essential viewing for anyone interested in that pivotal era.
