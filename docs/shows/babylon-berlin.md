## What It Feels Like to Watch

Babylon Berlin is a German production that rivals the most ambitious HBO dramas—but with a distinctly European sensibility. Set in Weimar Germany during the late 1920s and early 1930s, it drops you into a Berlin seething with political tension, artistic ferment, and criminal underworld activity.

You follow Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), a police detective transferred from Cologne to Berlin to investigate a case that pulls him into the city's depths. What he finds is a city on the edge—communists, Nazis, industrialists, and criminals all circling each other, waiting for the moment to strike.

The production values are extraordinary. This is the most expensive German TV series ever made, and it shows. Every frame looks like a painting. The attention to period detail is meticulous—the cars, the clothes, the sets, the technology. You believe you're in 1920s Berlin.

But it's not just pretty. The writing weaves multiple storylines—a noir mystery, a political thriller, a social drama—into a tapestry that reveals the rot beneath the glamour of the Weimar Republic. The series is critical of the forces that would destroy it from within while celebrating the art and culture it produced.

Liv Lisa Fries as Charlotte Ritter provides the audience surrogate—a young woman navigating Berlin's strict class system, working as a secretary by day and infiltrating the underground scene by night. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent.

Babylon Berlin proves that German television can match international standards while telling stories unique to its history. It's essential viewing for anyone interested in that pivotal era.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.70**

**Strengths:**
- **Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch)**: A haunted WWI veteran whose PTSD manifests as both vulnerability and determination. Bruch carries the weight of the series beautifully, portraying a man caught between his duty and his demons.
- **Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries)**: One of television's most compelling female leads. Her journey from typist to investigative journalist to political radical is seamlessly handled. Fries brings fierce intelligence and moral complexity.
- **Bruno Wolter (Peter Kurth)**: The mentor figure whose betrayal hits hard. Kurth brings paternal warmth that makes his eventual corruption devastating.
- **Nazi Reinhold (Martin Wuttke)**: A chilling portrayal of nascent fascism. Wuttke makes you understand how ordinary men become monsters.
- **Tatiana (Lena Urzendowsky)**: The Russian aristocrat entangled in the criminal underworld provides exotic intrigue without becoming a caricature.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Gereon's trauma can feel repetitive**: His flashbacks and panic attacks, while realistic, sometimes slow momentum.
- **Some supporting players lack depth**: Secondary characters often serve plot functions without full development.

**Why 8.5 and not 9.0**: The ensemble is strong but doesn't quite reach the iconic depth of The Wire or Boardwalk Empire. Some characters function more as types than fully realized individuals.

---

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 1.35**

**Strengths:**
- **Weimar Berlin as living organism**: The city is a character—its cabarets, its police stations, its underground clubs, its political rally grounds. You can navigate Berlin mentally.
- **Historical authenticity**: Every detail screams research. The cars, the fashion, the technology (from phonographs to early automobiles), the social hierarchies.
- **Political complexity**: The show depicts communists, Nazis, industrialists, and democrats without easy heroes. The era's ideological battles feel immediate.
- **Criminal ecosystem**: The bootlegging operations, the sex trafficking, the political violence—all interconnected.
- **Cultural richness**: The artistic ferment of the era—Kandinsky at the gallery, cabaret performances, jazz—makes the world feel alive.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Later seasons expand geographically**: The story moves beyond Berlin, which dilutes some of the concentrated atmosphere.
- **Some historical figures feel peripheral**: Real historical figures appear but don't always integrate fully into the narrative.

**Why 9.0**: The gold standard for period television world-building. Only Game of Thrones and The Wire approach this level of immersive world creation.

---

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 0.90**

**Strengths:**
- **Tom Tykwer's direction**: The co-creator brings his *Run Lola Run* energy to historical drama. Every frame is composed.
- **Period-perfect visuals**: The restoration of 1920s Berlin is breathtaking. Light and shadow evoke German Expressionism.
- **Tracking shots**: The show uses long takes to follow characters through crowded streets, nightclub floors, and crime scenes.
- **Color palette**: The contrasting warmth of the cabarets against the cold officialdom of police stations creates visual drama.
- **Iconic imagery**: The opening titles, the aerial views of Berlin, the night-time street scenes are instantly memorable.

**Weaknesses:**
- Some scenes favor beauty over function—gorgeous shots that don't advance story.
- The style is consistent but doesn't evolve significantly across seasons.

**Why 9.0**: Consistently beautiful and deliberately cinematic. Not quite as distinctive as Hannibal or The Knick, but approaching that level.

---

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 0.90**

**Strengths:**
- **Production scale**: The most expensive German TV series ever. Every set feels authentic and grand.
- **Period recreation**: Cars, trains, airplanes, buildings—the physical world is recreated with remarkable detail.
- **Action sequences**: The train heist in Season 1, the political violence, the chase through Berlin—these deliver.
- **Costume design**: The fashion of the era—from working-class clothes to aristocratic elegance—is spectacular.
- **Special effects**: The period-accurate visual effects enhance without overwhelming.

**Weaknesses:**
- The spectacle is primarily period authenticity rather than grand set pieces.
- No sequences quite reach the level of Game of Thrones' battles.

**Why 9.0**: Spectacular within its genre. The period recreation is itself a form of spectacle.

---

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 8.0

**Raw Score: 8.0 | Weighted: 1.20**

**Strengths:**
- **Political prophecy**: The show depicts the rise of fascism with clear-eyed understanding of how democracy dies.
- **Class and gender**: Charlotte's journey explores the limitations placed on women in the era.
- **Morality and compromise**: Characters constantly face choices between principles and survival.
- **Technology and modernity**: The tension between old and new—phonographs vs. radio, horses vs. cars—reflects broader themes.
- **Trauma and memory**: Gereon's war trauma and its effects on his present are handled with psychological sophistication.

**Weaknesses:**
- The conspiracy elements can overwhelm the character drama at times.
- Some themes are implied rather than explicitly explored.

**Why 8.0**: Dense with historical and political meaning, but not as intellectually challenging as Dark or The Leftovers.

---

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 8.0

**Raw Score: 8.0 | Weighted: 1.20**

**Strengths:**
- **Multiple storylines**: The show juggles crime procedural, political thriller, and personal drama without losing momentum.
- **Season-long mysteries**: Each season has a central mystery that builds to satisfying reveals.
- **Escalation**: The political stakes rise each season as the Nazis gain power.
- **Character momentum**: Characters evolve and change, keeping the story dynamic.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Pace can uneven**: Some episodes are slower than others, particularly in Season 2.
- **The conspiracy can overwhelm**: Too many moving parts sometimes dilute focus.

**Why 8.0**: Compelling but not relentless. Loses points to shows like 24 or Breaking Bad that maintain constant forward momentum.

---

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 8.0

**Raw Score: 8.0 | Weighted: 1.20**

**Strengths:**
- **Season finales**: Each season ends with major payoffs and cliffhangers.
- **Character arcs**: Major characters reach satisfying conclusions within seasons.
- **Historical inevitability**: The show uses historical knowledge to create dramatic irony—knowing where this era leads.
- **Thematic closure**: Each season explores its central themes fully.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Ongoing story**: The larger narrative continues across seasons, meaning individual resolutions are partial.
- **Final season**: The conclusion, while satisfying, leaves some threads open.

**Why 8.0**: Good resolution within seasons but the larger story continues. Not as conclusive as Breaking Bad, not as open as The Wire.
