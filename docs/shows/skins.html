            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Bristol teenagers: parties, drugs, sex, parents who don't understand. Each episode focuses on one character. The cast changes every two seasons. Jamie Brittain and Bryan Elsley created the definitive teen drama: raw, honest, controversial. The show that launched careers (Nicholas Hoult, Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya).

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The casts define their generations: Nicholas Hoult as Tony, Hannah Murray as Cassie, Dev Patel as Anwar, Lily Loveless as Naomi, and more. Each generation introduces new actors who become stars. The performances capture teenage intensity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Bristol teen life: the college, the houses, the clubs, the party scene. The world is British teen culture rendered without filter—parents incompetent, teachers irrelevant, friends everything.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>E4 production: handheld, bright, party scenes and comedowns. The style is youth television—the energy matters more than polish. Each character's episode has visual personality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is teenage life: parties, arguments, emotional breakdowns. The "spectacle" is the rawness—teenage experience without adult filter. The parties are staged, not spectacular.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Adolescence, identity, mental health, sexuality, class in Britain, the intensity of first everything. The show refuses to judge its characters—it presents them as they are. Profound teen drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode is one character's perspective. Each generation has two seasons. The structure allows character depth while maintaining momentum. The parties and the drama keep propulsive energy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Seven seasons with three generations. Each generation resolves; the show continues with new casts. The final season (Skins: Rise, Pure, Fire) provided closure for earlier characters. Complete in its structure.</p>
