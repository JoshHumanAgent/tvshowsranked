## What It Feels Like to Watch

Normal People is an intimate adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel. It follows the complex, on-again-off-again relationship between Connell and Marianne over several years—from high school in a small Irish town to university in Dublin.

You watch Normal People and feel every emotional beat. The series is remarkable for its subtlety—much of the storytelling happens in silences, glances, and small gestures. The performances by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal are extraordinary.

But the show deals with profound themes: class, power, mental health, and the difficulty of truly knowing another person. It's a love story that refuses easy answers.
