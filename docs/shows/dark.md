## What It Feels Like to Watch

Dark is a German time travel epic that demands your full attention—and rewards it tenfold. Set in the small town of Winden, it follows the disappearance of two children that reveals a web of secrets spanning four generations.

This isn't simple time travel. The rules are complex, the paradoxes are real, and the show never cheats. Everything connects—every character, every event, every time period. It's a puzzle box that pays off in ways you don't expect.

The production is gorgeous. The German forests, the caves, the nuclear power plant—everything looks ominous and beautiful. The score adds to the sense of dread.

The ensemble cast is remarkable. Multiple actors play the same characters at different ages, and it's seamless. You never lose track of who's who, even when time gets complicated.

Dark is challenging. You'll need to pay attention, maybe take notes. But if you're a fan of complex sci-fi like Primer or Tenet, this is your show. It's one of the most ambitious time travel narratives ever attempted.
