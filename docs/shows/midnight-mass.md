## What It Feels Like to Watch

Mike Flanagan follows up *The Haunting of Hill House* with another meditation on grief, faith, and the things we believe in when we have nothing else.

*Midnight Mass* takes place on Crockett Island, a dying fishing community off the coast. The population is shrinking, the church is closing, and the people are losing hope. Then a young priest arrives, and miracles begin to happen.

But this is a Flanagan production, so the miracles come with a price.

The show is deliberately slow. It builds atmosphere over action, exploring the characters' relationships with faith, loss, and each other. The dialogue is often explicitly religious — characters debate scripture, theology, and the nature of belief. This won't work for everyone. But for those who connect with it, the show offers something rare: a horror series that takes faith seriously.

Kate Siegel is excellent as Erin Greene, a young woman who has returned to the island after a tragedy. Zach Gilford plays her husband, a recovering alcoholic trying to rebuild his life. Hamish Linklater is the charismatic Father Paul — the priest who makes you believe, even when you shouldn't.

The horror builds slowly, then all at once. The final episodes are genuinely terrifying — not because of jump scares, but because of what they suggest about faith, sacrifice, and what we're willing to believe.

The show asks hard questions. What happens when the miracle you've been waiting for turns out to be something else? What do you do when your faith is tested, and you fail?

This is not *Hill House*. It's quieter, more meditative, and ultimately more devastating. But for fans of Flanagan's work, it's a worthy successor.

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.50**

With a score of 7.5, Kate Siegel delivers excellent work as Erin Greene, while Hamish Linklater brings charismatic intensity to Father Paul. The ensemble effectively portrays a community of believable people wrestling with faith and loss.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

The score of 7 reflects the effective creation of Crockett Island as a dying fishing community with a palpable sense of isolation and decline. The island's geography and social dynamics feel coherent, though the world is intentionally small and contained.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

With a score of 8, the cinematography creates atmospheric dread through moody island landscapes and carefully lit interiors. The visual approach emphasizes the contrast between sacred spaces and the horror that invades them.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 6

**Raw Score: 6 | Weighted: 0.60**

The modest score of 6 reflects that this is a slow-burn horror focused on atmosphere over spectacle. When visual elements arrive, they're effective but restrained—the show prioritizes psychological horror over visceral effects.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

The exceptional score of 9 comes from the show's serious engagement with faith, sacrifice, and belief—characters explicitly debate scripture and theology. The questions about what happens when miracles turn monstrous are explored with genuine philosophical weight.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

With a score of 7, the deliberately slow pacing builds atmosphere over action, which won't work for all viewers. The methodical unfolding creates mounting dread but occasionally tests patience.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

The high score of 9 reflects the devastating final episodes that bring the story to a haunting, theologically complex conclusion. The ending delivers on the slow build with genuine terror and profound emotional impact.
