## What It Feels Like to Watch

Mike Flanagan follows up *The Haunting of Hill House* with another meditation on grief, faith, and the things we believe in when we have nothing else.

*Midnight Mass* takes place on Crockett Island, a dying fishing community off the coast. The population is shrinking, the church is closing, and the people are losing hope. Then a young priest arrives, and miracles begin to happen.

But this is a Flanagan production, so the miracles come with a price.

The show is deliberately slow. It builds atmosphere over action, exploring the characters' relationships with faith, loss, and each other. The dialogue is often explicitly religious — characters debate scripture, theology, and the nature of belief. This won't work for everyone. But for those who connect with it, the show offers something rare: a horror series that takes faith seriously.

Kate Siegel is excellent as Erin Greene, a young woman who has returned to the island after a tragedy. Zach Gilford plays her husband, a recovering alcoholic trying to rebuild his life. Hamish Linklater is the charismatic Father Paul — the priest who makes you believe, even when you shouldn't.

The horror builds slowly, then all at once. The final episodes are genuinely terrifying — not because of jump scares, but because of what they suggest about faith, sacrifice, and what we're willing to believe.

The show asks hard questions. What happens when the miracle you've been waiting for turns out to be something else? What do you do when your faith is tested, and you fail?

This is not *Hill House*. It's quieter, more meditative, and ultimately more devastating. But for fans of Flanagan's work, it's a worthy successor.
