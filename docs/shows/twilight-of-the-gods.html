<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Viking mythology animated with extreme violence and adult themes. Sigrid, a mortal warrior, and Leif, a mortal king, face the gods of Asgard after Thor destroys their wedding. This is the Eddas filtered through Zack Snyder's visual sensibility: operatic violence, extreme slow-motion, gods as petty tyrants. The animation allows body horror and scale that live-action couldn't afford. Norse mythology for people who wanted Thor to have more blood and fewer jokes.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (6/10)</h3><p>Signature Snyder character work: archetypes elevated by voice performance. Sigrid is vengeance embodied; Leif is love refusing to die. The gods are capricious, cruel, beautiful. Voice cast includes recognizable names, but characters are functions of plot more than interior lives.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>Norse cosmology rendered: Asgard, Midgard, Hel, the World Tree. The gods have distinct domains and personalities. The mythology is accurate (for Snyder's purposes)—Ragnarok looms, the Norns spin fate. The world feels ancient and hostile.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>The animation style is distinctive: angular, stylized, constantly in motion. Snyder's signature slow-motion highlights violence. The palette is fire and shadow. The gods appear more as forces of nature than people. Visually coherent, for those who like the style.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3><p>The animation allows spectacle impossible in live-action: Thor's lightning rending landscapes, giants walking through dimensions, the World Tree burning. Every episode has set pieces that would cost hundreds of millions in live-action. The violence is the point.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3><p>Fate versus free will. Love as motivation for war. The gods as tyrants deserving overthrow. The themes are mythological standard—Snyder adds visual intensity, not philosophical depth. Ragnarok is inevitable; how you face it matters.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3><p>Quest structure: gather allies, face trials, confront gods. Each episode adds to Sigrid's army or reveals new obstacle. The pacing is Snyder-standard: slow-build punctuated by explosive release. The journey is predictable; the execution provides interest.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Complete limited series. Ragnarok happens, as foretold. The emotional arcs conclude: Sigrid's vengeance, Leif's devotion, the gods' fall. You know where it ends; the pleasure is in the visual interpretation of familiar myth.</p></div></section>
