            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Joel Fleischman is a New York doctor who agrees to work in Alaska to pay for medical school. He ends up in Cicely, a town of eccentrics: a pilot, a DJ, a former astronaut, a Native American shaman. The show is Magical realism in small-town Alaska: philosophical, whimsical, the 90s answer to Twin Peaks without the darkness. One of television's great ensemble dramedies.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Rob Morrow as Joel is the straight man surrounded by eccentrics. Janine Turner as Maggie, John Corbett as Chris, Barry Corbin as Maurice, Cynthia Geary as Shelly—the town is a gallery of distinct personalities. The performances embrace the show's magical realist tone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Cicely, Alaska: the town, the radio station, the bar, the wilderness. The world is complete and specific—the seasons, the isolation, the indigenous presence, the eccentric history. The town is a character; the setting is the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Early 90s TV aesthetics: functional, the beauty of Alaska captured when possible. The style serves the characters and the philosophical musings. Not distinctive, but appropriate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is Alaska: the wilderness, the seasons, the Aurora Borealis. The show uses the landscape as backdrop for philosophical moments. Nature as spectacle, character as focus.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Community, the clash between urban and rural values, indigenous culture and white settlement, the search for meaning in isolation. The show explores philosophy through whimsy—each episode a fable about how to live. Intellectual without being pretentious.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic with ongoing development: Joel's contract, various romances, the town's events. The drive is gentle—this is not plot television, it's character television. The pleasure is returning to Cicely, not seeing what happens next.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Six seasons. Joel eventually leaves Alaska; the show continued without him but lost its center. The complete run is available; the ending is appropriate if not definitive. The show's peak was seasons 2-4.</p>
