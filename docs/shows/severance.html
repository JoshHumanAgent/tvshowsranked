<h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
<p>Work-life balance taken to nightmare extreme. Dan Erickson's Severance imagines a procedure that separates your work memories from your personal life—"innies" at work, "outies" at home, never the twain shall meet. Adam Scott's Mark leads a team at Lumon Industries, discovering that what they do—and what the company hides—is profoundly wrong.</p>
<p>The aesthetic is corporate uncanny: fluorescent-lit hallways that stretch forever, offices that feel like liminal spaces, a 1970s-80s design sensibility that suggests time has stopped. The tone shifts between workplace comedy and existential horror.</p>
<p>The mystery structure is classic: what does Lumon do? What happened to Mark's wife? What is the board room? Season 1 builds to one of television's great cliffhangers—the innies briefly awake in the outside world.</p>
<p>Two seasons and ongoing. Ben Stiller's direction creates sustained uncanny tension. The show's thesis is implicit: we compartmentalize at what cost?</p>

<h3>7-Dimension Algorithmic Analysis</h3>
<div class="dimension-block"><div class="dimension-header"><span class="dimension-score">7.5</span><div><div class="dimension-name">Characters & Acting</div><div class="dimension-weight">Weight: 20% | Weighted Contribution: 1.50</div></div></div><div class="dimension-content"><p><strong>The Benchmark:</strong> The Sopranos has Tony (9.5). Severance centers on Mark and his Lumon team.</p><p><strong>The Analysis:</strong> Adam Scott's Mark is grief and curiosity—the outie mourning his wife, the innie discovering conspiracy. Britt Lower's Helly is rebellion incarnate. John Turturro's Irving and Zach Cherry's Dylan provide team texture. Tramell Tillman's Milchick is corporate horror: friendly, menacing, unrelenting.</p><p><strong>Why 7.5:</strong> Strong ensemble with distinctive corporate-uncanny tone. The dual-persona structure limits character depth.</p></div></div>
<div class="dimension-block"><div class="dimension-header"><span class="dimension-score">8.5</span><div><div class="dimension-name">World Building</div><div class="dimension-weight">Weight: 15% | Weighted Contribution: 1.28</div></div></div><div class="dimension-content"><p><strong>The Analysis:</strong> Lumon Industries is fully realized—the severed floor, the departments, the rules, the mythology. The Eagan family founders provide cult-like corporate history. The outside world hints at broader implications.</p><p><strong>Why 8.5:</strong> Corporate world-building at its finest. The rules of severance have internal logic. Lumon is a complete ecology of workplace horror.</p></div></div>

Every frame is composed for discomfort. The visual distinction between innie and outie worlds is precise.</p><p><strong>Why 8.5:</strong> Distinctive visual style. Corporate uncanny rendered beautifully. The hallway sequences are iconic.</p></div></div>
<div class="dimension-block"><div class="dimension-header"><span class="dimension-score">6.5</span><div><div class="dimension-name">Visual Spectacle</div><div class="dimension-weight">Weight: 10% | Weighted Contribution: 0.65</div></div></div><div class="dimension-content"><p><strong>The Analysis:</strong> The spectacle is conceptual—the severed floor, the board room, the testing room. The visual impact is in discomfort rather than scale.</p><p><strong>Why 6.5:</strong> Effective uncanny but limited spectacle. Corporate horror doesn't require visual grandeur.</p></div></div>
<div class="dimension-block"><div class="dimension-header"><span class="dimension-score">9</span><div><div class="dimension-name">Conceptual Density</div><div class="dimension-weight">Weight: 15% | Weighted Contribution: 1.35</div></div></div><div class="dimension-content"><p><strong>The Analysis:</strong> Work-life balance as horror. Corporate control through memory. Identity as commodity. The show interrogates what we sacrifice for employment, what we compartmentalize to survive. The Eagan family cult provides corporate theology.</p><p><strong>Why 9:</strong> High-concept workplace horror. Memory, identity, corporate control as subjects. Dense with ideas about work and self.</p></div></div>

What's the board room? What happened to Mark's wife? Every answer opens questions. The season 1 finale is among television's great cliffhangers.</p><p><strong>Why 9:</strong> Mystery momentum at highest level. Every episode reveals and deepens.
