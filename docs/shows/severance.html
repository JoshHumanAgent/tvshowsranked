<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Lumon Industries has a procedure: severance. Your work memories are separated from your outside memories. You are two people. Mark leads a team of severed workers. Then he finds a clue from the outside. Ben Stiller directs the sci-fi thriller about work-life balance made literal horror.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Adam Scott as Mark: the innie and the outie. Patricia Arquette as Harmony: the manager. John Turturro, Christopher Walken, Britt Lower. The performances capture the dissociation—two selves in one body.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>Lumon: the office, the severed floor, the outside, the departments that don't know each other. The world is corporate horror—work separated from life, literally. Every detail matters.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Apple TV+ production: the office as liminal space, the corridors, the weird geometry. The style is Kubrickian—symmetry, unease, beauty made unsettling.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the office: the corridors, the break room, the mysterious departments. The "spectacle" is the concept—watching two selves in one body.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Work-life balance made literal, whether we can escape ourselves, what corporations own, the self as property, identity as division. The show explores these through sci-fi horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (10/10)</h3><p>What is Lumon hiding? What happens on the severed floor? Who are the outies? The structure is mystery—every episode reveals more. The drive is relentless.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>Ongoing. Season 1 ends on cliffhanger; season 2 in production. The mystery is unresolved. The journey is spectacular; the destination is pending.</p></div></section>
