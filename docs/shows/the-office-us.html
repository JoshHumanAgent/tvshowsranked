<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Michael Scott manages with inappropriate love. Jim loves Pam. Dwight is Dwight. Greg Daniels adapted Ricky Gervais's British original into the defining American sitcom of the streaming era.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Steve Carell as Michael Scott: impossible to replace. John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer as Jim and Pam. Rainn Wilson as Dwight. The ensemble created characters who became cultural touchstones.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Dunder Mifflin: the office, the warehouse, the conference room, the break room. The world is a paper company in decline—everyone knows a workplace like this.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>Mockumentary style: talking heads, handheld cameras. The format creates intimacy and cringe. Visual simplicity serves the comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is an office. The "spectacle" is watching people work and fail.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Workplace as family, finding meaning in mundane jobs, the American Dream in decline. The themes are light but present.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Jim and Pam's relationship; Michael's management; the office dynamics. The structure is episodic comedy with serialized romance.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Nine seasons, complete. Michael's departure; Jim and Pam's marriage; the documentary reveals. A satisfying ending to a defining sitcom.</p></div></section>
