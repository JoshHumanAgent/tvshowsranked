<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Georgia Lass dies on her lunch break, hit by a toilet seat falling from the MIR space station. She becomes a grim reaper, collecting souls in Seattle's undead service economy. Dead Like Me is Bryan Fuller's first masterpiece: death as bureaucracy, afterlife as minimum-wage job, existential dread as dark comedy. Ellen Muth plays George with perfectly calibrated apathy and yearning. The show asks what you'd do with death if it was your day job. Life is short; so is the series. Every moment is bittersweet.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Ellen Muth's George is the perfect disillusioned eighteen-year-old, killed before she could grow up. Mandy Patinkin as head reaper Rube delivers paternal gruffness with soul. Callum Blue and Jasmine Guy create the found-family dynamics. The performances balance mortality with humor—you believe these people have been reaping for decades and still find it exhausting.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>The reaper system is fully realized: undead bureaucracy, soul-gravel, post-it notifications, rules and bylaws. George's "real" life (her surviving family) continues without her, creating ongoing tragedy. The show builds a cosmology from mundane materials: death as civil service.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>Early-2000s Showtime aesthetic—functional without visual ambition. The death scenes have practical effects. Seattle is present but not foregrounded. The style serves the premise rather than elevating it.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is conceptual: watching reapers collect souls, seeing the gravel beneath the skin. Occasionally violent deaths rendered. The show treats the supernatural as job site, marvel stripped.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Death as work. The bureaucracy of mortality. The living as processes—the dead as witness. What happens to family when you can't contact them? The show explores what makes life meaningful by showing the people who've lost it but continue working. The mundane nature of death, if accepted, becomes profound.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Episodic by design: soul of the week format. The serialized thread is George's emotional arc—learning death isn't escape from being human. Each episode balances self-contained reaper work with character development. The pacing is steady, the stakes small and cumulative.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Cancelled after season 2, with a later direct-to-video movie. The series finale doesn't conclude arcs—but the episodic structure means it doesn't need to. George learns, changes, remains. The movie is widely considered skippable. The series stands as slice of afterlife.</p></div></section>
