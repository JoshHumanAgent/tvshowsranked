<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">The Salinger parents are killed by a drunk driver. Five children are left to raise themselves. Charlie, Bailey, Julia, Claudia, and baby Owen. 90s family drama: grief, growing up, and staying together. The show that launched stars.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Matthew Fox, Scott Wolf, Neve Campbell, Lacey Chabert. The ensemble carried the show through six seasons. The performances were the show's foundation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (6/10)</h3><p>San Francisco: the restaurant, the house, the siblings' lives. The world is family tragedy made weekly.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>90s Fox production: the visual style of family drama. Functional and dated.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. Family drama about grief and growing up.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Grief, responsibility, family as choice, growing up too fast. The show explored heavy themes for network TV.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Each sibling's journey; the family's survival. Family drama structure with real stakes.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Six seasons, complete. The siblings grow up, move on. The ending earned the journey.</p></div></section>
