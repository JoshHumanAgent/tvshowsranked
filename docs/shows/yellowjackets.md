## What It Feels Like to Watch

Yellowjackets plays with time like few shows dare. Every episode splits between two timelines: 1996, when a high school soccer team's plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and the present day, where survivors deal with the long shadow of what happened. The show never tells you everything, and that is part of its genius.

You watch the teen survivors descend into something primal. The performances from the young cast are raw and fearless. You see them change, not just physically but morally, as hunger and isolation work their dark magic. The adult storylines are equally compelling, with Melanie Lynskey as Shauna and Juliette Lewis as Natalie delivering performances of depth and pain.

The show leans into horror but refuses easy categorization. Is it supernatural? Psychological? Both? The ambiguity is intentional and maddening. It keeps you theorizing, keeps you watching, keeps you unsettled.

The editing between timelines creates a narrative momentum that never lets you rest. You are always discovering something. The show is smart about what it reveals and when, doling out information in ways that reward careful viewing.

What makes Yellowjackets resonate is its commitment to showing what trauma does to people—not just the event, but the haunting. You watch characters who should have died years ago struggling to live with the choices they made. It is a show about survival, yes, but also about what survival costs.
