            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Florida forever—the Keys, where blue water meets blue sky and something is rotting underneath. A family gathering at a beachside resort, everyone smiling, everyone hiding. The black sheep returns, and the past comes with him. You're watching a drowning in slow motion, salt water filling lungs while tourists sunbathe nearby. It's Revenge of the Nerds if the nerds became Florida hoteliers and one of them was a drug dealer.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Rayburns are Shakespearean—each damaged in their own way. Kyle Chandler anchors as John, the "good brother" who isn't. Ben Mendelsohn as Danny is electric: the addict, the failure, the trigger that sets everything in motion. Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard bring gravitas as the parents with secrets. Linda Cardellini, Norbert Leo Butz, Jacinda Barrett—the ensemble is deep and committed. This is actor heaven.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The Florida Keys become a character—the heat, the water, the tourism economy, the drug routes. The Rayburn House is a kingdom under siege. Around it: a police department, a local community, a Mexican cartel operation. The world is intimate but complete. You feel the humidity, smell the salt air, understand the isolation that breeds secrets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix's first prestige drama looked the part. Wide shots of azure water, close-ups of sweating faces, the interplay of light and shadow suited to moral ambiguity. The visual language is Florida noir—bright surfaces hiding dark depths. The hurricane episode is particularly effective, the storm outside matching the chaos within.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>This isn't spectacle television. The spectacle is emotional—a body being moved, a confession at gunpoint, a sibling betrayal. The setting provides natural beauty, but the show isn't about visual grandeur. It's about people in rooms, hurting each other. The spectacle is psychological.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Family as cage. The sins of the father. The lie that becomes truth. Bloodline explores how trauma passes through generations, how "good people" become monsters one decision at a time. The show asks: what would you do to protect your family? What have you already done? The themes are classical, executed with modern psychological precision.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 is propulsive—the flash-forwards to Danny's fate create irresistible tension. Seasons 2-3 lose momentum as consequences unfold. The show burns slow, which works in the beginning but drags as resolutions postpone. This is a story that needed to be tighter, a tragedy that could've been two seasons instead of three.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1's ending is devastating. Seasons 2-3 are aftermath—watching consequences play out without the original engine of tension. Netflix canceled it before the creators planned, forcing a compressed conclusion. The ending works but doesn't soar. What began as Shakespeare ends as competent tragedy, not King Lear.</p>
