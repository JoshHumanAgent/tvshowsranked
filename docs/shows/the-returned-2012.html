            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                In a small French mountain town, the dead return. Not as zombies—as themselves. They haven't aged; they don't know they died. A teenager who died in a bus crash walks home. A murdered woman appears at her husband's door. The returned integrate back into their families, but something is wrong: they're hungry, the water level in the reservoir is rising, and the town holds secrets. French supernatural drama as mood piece—unsettling without horror, emotional without sentimentality.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The ensemble captures grief and denial: parents confronted with children they've mourned, spouses with partners they've buried. Clotilde Hesme as Adele, Anne Consigny as Claire, the children returned and changed. The performances are restrained, French in the best way—interior, complex, without American melodrama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The town is specific: the dam, the reservoir covering the old village, the mountains, the pub where secrets are exchanged. The supernatural rules are unclear—the returned exist, they're hungry, they're drawn together—but the mystery is atmospheric rather than puzzle-box. The world is mood.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Mogwai's score sets the tone: instrumental post-rock that's haunting without being scary. The photography matches—grey skies, the reservoir's still water, the town's mundane beauty made uncanny. The show looks like memory: soft, slightly wrong, permanent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. The returned look normal; the supernatural is presence, not effects. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching families confront their dead. Subtle, psychological, European.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, acceptance, whether the dead should remain dead, what we owe to those we've lost. The show explores mourning as a process disrupted—how do you grieve someone who returns? The themes are handled obliquely, through character rather than exposition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The mystery propels: why are they back? What do they want? What happened to the old village? The pacing is deliberate—this is French art television, not American thriller. Patient viewers rewarded; others may find it slow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled. The first season is complete enough; the second expands the mythology without resolution. The American remake failed. The French original remains incomplete but beautiful—worth watching for mood and moment rather than answers.</p>
