            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Luther is a British crime thriller about a detective whose intensity borders on obsession, and the serial killers he pursues with equal parts skill and damage. Idris Elba plays John Luther, a man who sees the darkness too clearly because he shares it. The show doesn't pretend Luther is simply a cop on the edge of burnout; it explores how close someone can come to understanding monsters without becoming one.</p>

            <p>The procedural structure—cases each season, killers with methods and signature trophies—serves as framework for Luther's psychological profile. He is violent, obsessive, isolated, and capable of empathy with killers that borders on affinity. Ruth Wilson's Alice Morgan is the show's signature creation: a psychiatrist and murderer who becomes Luther's intellectual equal and possibly his mirror. Their relationship suggests shared damage rather than simple hunter-prey antagonism.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes Luther from other procedurals is aesthetic and scale. London is shot in rain and darkness—the city is always threatening, always noir. The killers are theatrical in ways that suggest psychopathology as performance. Elba's physical presence—impatient, large, constantly vibrating with barely suppressed energy—creates a detective who seems genuinely dangerous. Luther became a vehicle for its star, but the supporting cast and writing justify the showcase.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2e>
            <p>Luther earns its ranking through Idris Elba's commanding presence, atmosphere that matches its detective, and killers worth hunting. The score reflects a show that elevated crime thriller through commitment and style.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Idris Elba is the show—Luther's damage, intelligence, and capacity for violence are all physically manifested. Ruth Wilson's Alice Morgan is the ideal antagonist, smart enough to challenge him, damaged enough to mirror him. Supporting criminals are given enough specificity to register as individuals rather than plot devices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>London noir—a city constantly rainy, dark, where violence happens without witnesses. The police station, the streets, Luther's isolation in empty spaces. The world is primarily psychological rather than geographical, filtered through Luther's damaged perception.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Atmospheric direction that favors night, rain, shadow. The camera catches Elba's physicality—his impatience with paperwork, his focus on crime scenes. The thriller sequences are shot for tension without excess.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is in performance intensity, set piece moments of confrontation, and the occasional spectacular killer tableau. This is British television—modest spectacle in service of genre, not effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores proximity to evil, the costs of empathy, and whether obsession is heroism or pathology. The ideas are present but rarely developed beyond thriller requirements. Luther's psychology provides consistent character; deeper themes wait in the text.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Case-of-the-season structure provides momentum; Luther's personal life creates episodic B-plots. The pacing accommodates British scheduling—fewer episodes than American procedurals, more time to breathe. The tension is maintained throughout each season.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season reaches appropriate climax with the case resolved, but Luther's personal arcs repeat damage-atonement patterns. The show cycles through similar emotional beats across seasons. Resolution comes for cases; the detective is eternal.</p>
