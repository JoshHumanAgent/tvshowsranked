<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">DCI John Luther is obsessive, brilliant, and dangerous. He catches serial killers by thinking like them. Idris Elba is Luther: the detective as force of nature. Each season brings a new case, a new nemesis. Neil Cross created the detective as gothic hero.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Idris Elba as Luther: intensity, violence, moral complexity. Ruth Wilson as Alice Morgan: the psychopath who understands him. The guest villains (David Tennant, Paul McGann) bring the cases. Elba owns the role.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>London: the murders, the police stations, the darkness under the city. The world is gothic London—the city as labyrinth, the cases as descent.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>BBC production: London photographed for noir, the cases staged for horror. The style is gothic—the camera loves the darkness.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the cases: serial killers, elaborate murders, the darkness. The "spectacle" is Luther's intensity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Obsession, the cost of justice, whether we can fight monsters without becoming them, the detective as destroyer. The show explores these through Luther's cases.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Each season is a case: the killer, the hunt, the cost. The structure is procedural gothic—the drive is Luther's obsession.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Five seasons plus film. Each season resolves its case; Luther's story continues. The film (2023) provided further continuation. The character endures.</p></div></section>
