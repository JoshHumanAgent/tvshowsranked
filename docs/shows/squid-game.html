<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">456 desperate people play children's games for money. Losers die. Hwang Dong-hyuk created capitalism as death tournament: Korean debt culture, class warfare, human life as entertainment. Red Light, Green Light became horror. The most-watched Netflix series ever.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Lee Jung-jae as Gi-hun: the gambler who might be good. Park Hae-soo as Sang-woo: the success story who failed. Wi Ha-jun as the detective. The performances capture desperation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>The island facility: the dormitories, the game arenas, the VIP room. Children's games made deadly. The front man revealed slowly. Capitalism rendered as game.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: bright colors, geometric design, horror in playground aesthetics. "Red Light, Green Light" is iconic visual horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3><p>The games are spectacular: giant doll, tug of war over water, glass bridge crossing. Production design is stunning.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Capitalism as death game, desperation and choice, the poor as entertainment, human worth measured in won. Brutal clarity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (10/10)</h3><p>Survive or die. Each game eliminates players. The structure is survival horror—impossible to stop watching.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Season 1 complete story. Season 2 announced. The phenomenon was season 1—expansion is bonus.</p></div></section>
