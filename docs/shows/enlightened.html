            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Amy Jellicoe has a nervous breakdown at work. She goes to a Hawaiian treatment center, comes back transformed, and tries to live consciously in a world that doesn't care. Laura Dern created and stars; Mike White writes and co-stars. The show is cringe comedy combined with genuine spiritual inquiry: can you be enlightened in corporate America? Amy tries, fails, tries again. Painful, beautiful, unlike anything else.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Laura Dern's Amy is one of television's great performances: self-deluded, self-righteous, genuinely seeking, impossible to dismiss. Mike White as Tyler is her opposite: quiet, damaged, kind. The supporting cast captures corporate America in all its soullessness. Dern's Emmy was well-deserved; everyone else matches her level.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Corporate California: the office park, the wellness retreat, the apartment complex, the mother-daughter dynamic. The world is small but specific—Amy's workplace is a bureaucracy crushing souls, her apartment is a prison of good intentions. Accurate to a painful degree.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO half-hour: functional, appropriate. The style doesn't distinguish; the writing and acting do. The Hawaiian retreat is photographed with appropriate beauty; the office with appropriate sterility. Television that doesn't get in its own way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is a woman trying to be better while everyone around her wishes she'd stop. The "spectacle" is watching someone fail with good intentions, succeed by accident, and confuse the two.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Spiritual seeking in materialist culture, the limits of self-help, whether enlightenment is possible in late capitalism. The show asks whether individual transformation matters when systems are oppressive. Amy's earnestness is both mocked and honored—the show knows she's ridiculous, and knows she's right. Complex, sophisticated, unique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Half-hour episodes, two seasons. The drive is Amy's quest: to be better, to change her workplace, to connect. Season 2's corporate-whistleblower plot provides serialized momentum. The cringe comedy makes episodes fly by; the emotional content makes them land.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled before full resolution but ending on a perfect note. Amy exposes corporate malfeasance, loses her job, gains her integrity. The final scene is her walking away, transformed, uncertain, alive. The cancellation hurts; the ending works regardless.</p>
