            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Narcos is a crime drama that chronicles the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar and the DEA agents who pursued him. The first two seasons follow Escobar's cocaine empire in Colombia, from its beginnings through its violent peak to the manhunt that ended in his death. The show combines documentary-style narration with dramatization, using real footage and photos to ground the fiction in history. Wagner Moura plays Escobar as a man whose modesty—plain clothes, soft voice—masks absolute ruthlessness.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes Narcos from other drug-trade dramas is its scope. The show depicts not just Escobar but the entire ecosystem: the farmers growing coca, the chemists processing it, the smugglers moving it, the politicians bought by it, the journalists killed for reporting on it, the Americans whose demand created the market, and the DEA agents whose jurisdiction is limited by sovereignty. It's not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's a portrait of an industry and its consequences.</p>

            <p>After Escobar's death, the show continues with Narcos: Mexico, shifting focus to the rise of the Guadalajara cartel. The structure works because the drug trade itself is the subject; Escobar was one manifestation, not the whole story. The show's violence is frequent and brutal, appropriate to its subject. The narration by DEA agent Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook) provides American perspective while the Colombian characters provide local truth.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Narcos earns its ranking through Wagner Moura's transformation as Escobar, scope that captures an entire industry, and production values that make Colombia in the 1980s immersive. The score reflects a crime drama that transcends the genre through documentary ambition.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Wagner Moura's Escobar is the signature performance—soft-spoken, physically unimposing, morally empty. The DEA agents provide American perspective without dominating the narrative. The Colombian ensemble creates a world where Escobar is one player among many, however powerful.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8.5/10)</h3>
                <p>1980s Colombia is rendered with attention to politics, geography, and the economics of the drug trade. The world includes farmers and presidents, hitmen and journalists. The scope is comprehensive without being overwhelming.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The documentary style—real footage, voice-over narration—creates authenticity that pure dramatization couldn't achieve. Colombia is shot with attention to its beauty and its danger. The direction balances action with political context.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is violence—gunfights, assassinations, bombings. The production recreates historical events with attention to accuracy. This isn't action cinema; it's historical recreation with dramatic license.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores the drug trade as an industry with economics and politics, not just crime. It acknowledges American demand without excusing Colombian supply. The questions about sovereignty, corruption, and whether law enforcement can solve what is fundamentally a problem of demand are present if not resolved.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The historical structure provides inherent momentum—Escobar rises, rules, falls. The manhunt creates thriller tension while the broader context provides documentary interest. The transition to Mexico after Escobar's death refreshes the formula.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Escobar's story ends where history ended—with his death. The Mexico seasons provide their own arcs based on cartel history. The show completes what it starts while remaining open to the broader subject of the drug trade.</p>
