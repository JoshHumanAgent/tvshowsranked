## What It Feels Like to Watch

There is a joy to It's a Sin that might surprise you. Yes, it deals with the AIDS crisis in 1980s Britain, yes, it deals with death and fear and prejudice—but at its heart, this is a celebration. A celebration of friendship, of community, of the absurdity and beauty of being young and queer and alive.

You meet Ritchie (Olly Alexander), a bright young thing who has just arrived in London from the Isle of Wight. He moves into a flat with Colin and Ash, and you watch as they build a family of choice. These are men who should have had decades ahead of them, and you know—even as you watch them laugh, dance, fall in love, make mistakes—that history has other plans.

Russell T Davies writes with such warmth and wit that the first few episodes feel almost buoyant. The colors are bright, the music is period-perfect, the conversations are sharp and funny. This is what it felt like to be young and queer in London in the early 80s: dangerous, exhilarating, free.

And then the shadow falls. The first death. The first friend in the hospital. The way the world looks at you when they know. The show does not look away from the horror—the wasting, the ignorance, the prejudice that killed as surely as the virus—but it never loses its essential message: these men lived. They loved. They mattered.

By the final episode, you will be wrecked. Not because it's manipulative, but because it's true. These stories needed to be told, and they needed to be told with this much heart. It's a Sin is not just important television—it is essential television.
