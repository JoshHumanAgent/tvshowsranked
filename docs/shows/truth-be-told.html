            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Poppy Parnell is a true-crime podcaster. Her investigations reopen old cases, question old verdicts, and confront old wounds. Octavia Spencer is Poppy: the journalist whose work both heals and harms. Each season is a new case, a new investigation, a new set of consequences.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Octavia Spencer carries the show: the podcaster with conscience, the investigator with personal stakes. The guest casts (Aaron Paul in season 1, Kate Hudson in season 2) provide the cases. Spencer is the constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The podcast world: recording studios, investigation scenes, the families affected by the crimes. The world expands each season—new cases, new victims, new suspects. The setting is contemporary media landscape.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ production: true-crime aesthetics rendered for drama. The style is functional—the investigation, the interviews, the reveals. The podcast aesthetic is integrated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is investigation: interviews, research, confrontations. The "spectacle" is the revelation—watching Poppy uncover the truth. Character-driven mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>True crime as entertainment, whether reopening wounds helps or harms, the ethics of investigation, the cost of truth. The show explores the true-crime phenomenon from within.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season investigates a case: what really happened, who's guilty, what's the cost of knowing. The structure is mystery—the drive is the question and the answer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons. Each season resolves its case; Poppy's character continues. The show explores true-crime ethics across cases. Seasonal mysteries, serialized character.</p>
