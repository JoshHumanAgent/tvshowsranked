## What It Feels Like to Watch

In 2015, two convicted murderers — Richard Matt and David Sweat — escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York. They did it by tunneling through the wall, using tools smuggled in by a female prison worker. *Escape at Dannemora* tells this improbable true story.

Benicio Del Toro is Richard Matt, a charming but dangerous con. Paul Dano is David Sweat, the younger, more desperate prisoner. The real star, though, is Patricia Arquette as Joyce "Tilly" Mitchell, the prison worker who gets involved with both men and helps them escape.

The show is directed by Ben Stiller, and it's one of his best works — a stark, claustrophobic thriller that focuses on the escape itself. The tunnels are cramped, the tension is relentless, and the performances are exceptional.

What makes the show work is its humanity. These are terrible people who did terrible things, but the show finds moments of compassion. Joyce isn't a villain — she's a lonely woman who got in over her head.

The escape took weeks to plan and execute, and the show captures every moment of that painstaking process. The finale is edge-of-your-seat stuff.
