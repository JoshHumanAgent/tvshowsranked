## What It Feels Like to Watch

In 1980s Arkansas, two children disappear on Halloween night. Detectives Wayne Hays and Roland West investigate — and the case haunts them for decades, through the men's marriages, careers, and memories.

The third season of *True Detective* is a return to form after the disappointment of season two. Mahershala Ali is extraordinary as Wayne Hays — a detective whose memory is failing but whose sense of guilt remains. Carmen Ejogo is excellent as his wife Amelia, who writes a book about the case.

The show spans three timelines: 1980, 1990, and 2015. This structure allows the show to explore how the case affected the detectives' lives over decades. The mystery is well-crafted, but the real focus is on the characters.

The show was created and written by Nic Pizzolatto, who also created the first season, and it feels like a return to the philosophical depth and atmospheric dread of that initial run.

This is a show about memory, time, and the weight of unresolved trauma. It's not as transcendent as season one, but it's excellent television.
