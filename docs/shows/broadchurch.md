## What It Feels Like to Watch

In the seaside town of Broadchurch, a young boy is found dead on the beach. The investigation that follows tears apart a community that thought it knew everyone.

This is British mystery at its finest. The first season is almost perfect — a whodunit where everyone is a suspect, where the grief is real, and where the resolution is devastating. Created by Chris Chibnall (who later created *Doctor Who*), it's a masterclass in building tension.

Olivia Colman is DI Miller — a detective from London who is assigned to the case and must navigate a community that doesn't want outsiders. David Tennant is Ellingham — the father of the murdered boy, a local newspaper owner who becomes obsessed with finding the killer.

The show is beautiful to look at: the Dorset coastline is a character in itself, adding atmosphere and dread. The supporting cast is excellent, and the show is patient — it takes its time with each episode, letting the mystery unfold naturally.

The second and third seasons expand the world but don't quite reach the heights of the first. Still, *Broadchurch* remains essential viewing for fans of the genre.
