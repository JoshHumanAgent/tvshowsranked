<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Mark and Jeremy are flatmates in Croydon. Mark is a loan officer with anxiety. Jeremy is a wannabe musician with delusions. We hear their thoughts. Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain created the longest-running Channel 4 comedy—failure as art.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>David Mitchell as Mark: anxiety made flesh. Robert Webb as Jeremy: delusion incarnate. Their internal monologues reveal everything they won't say. Iconic British comedy duo.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>Croydon flat: the office, the parties, the failed relationships. The world is disappointment—the specific texture of British male failure.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>Point-of-view camera: we see what they see, hear what they think. The style is intimate—sometimes uncomfortably close.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is failure in a flat. The "spectacle" is watching people make terrible choices.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Male friendship, delusion vs. anxiety, the lies we tell ourselves, British class dynamics. The show explores failure with uncomfortable honesty.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3><p>Mark and Jeremy fail at work, relationships, life. Episodic disasters. The drive is schadenfreude.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Nine seasons, complete. Mark and Jeremy remain themselves. The show never betrays its premise. Consistency as achievement.</p></div></section>
