            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Yonkers, New York, 1987. A federal court orders public housing built in white neighborhoods. The city explodes. Mayor Nick Wasicsko tries to do the right thing and is destroyed for it. The white residents are certain their neighborhoods will be ruined; the Black residents just want decent places to live. David Simon's compassionate camera captures everyone's humanity, even those on the wrong side of history. It's The Wire's moral universe applied to housing policy.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Oscar Isaac as Wasicsko is brilliant—a man who becomes mayor almost by accident, then is destroyed by the act of governing. Catherine Keener, Alfred Molina, Winona Ryder, and Bob Balaban create a complete ecosystem of Yonkers players. The non-professional actors playing residents bring documentary authenticity. Every performance serves the whole. Simon's casting, as always, is immaculate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Yonkers rendered as microcosm: row houses, project apartments, city council chambers, political backrooms. The city's geography is the conflict—the white neighborhoods, the Black neighborhoods, the demarcation lines. The show teaches while it dramatizes: how housing policy works, how segregation persists, how change happens (or doesn't). Simon's journalism-as-drama approach creates complete worlds.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Functional and effective. Simon's shows look like documentaries—unobtrusive camera, natural light, real locations. The style serves the content: this happened, these are the stakes. The housing units themselves become visual motifs: the ones being torn down, the ones being built, the ones people fight to avoid.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people in rooms, talking, deciding, fighting. The spectacle is the conflict itself: protests, courtroom battles, elections. But the show finds drama in bureaucratic process—how policy becomes reality, how principle faces power. The "spectacle" is procedural intensity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Housing segregation as American original sin. The show explores NIMBYism, institutional racism, the difference between personal decency and political courage, the destruction wrought by good intentions facing organized resistance. Wasicsko's arc is about the cost of doing right in a system that punishes it. Simon's most didactic work is also his most morally complex.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The pace is deliberate—this is David Simon, not Aaron Sorkin. Each episode advances the timeline and the stakes, but momentum builds through understanding rather than acceleration. Audiences seeking thrills will be bored; audiences seeking civic education dramatized will be riveted. The drive is intellectual as much as emotional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries: Wasicsko's rise and fall, the housing built, the resistance fading, the costs tallied. The ending includes the real Wasicsko's fate—a gut-punch that contextualizes everything. Simon knows how to conclude: with truth rather than triumph. Among HBO's finest miniseries.</p>
