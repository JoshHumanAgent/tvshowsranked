            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Raymond "Red" Reddington turns himself into the FBI. He has a list of criminals the FBI doesn't know about. He'll help catch them, but only if he works with profiler Elizabeth Keen. James Spader is Red: charming, dangerous, always five steps ahead. Ten seasons of criminal mastermind as consultant.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>James Spader is the show: the voice, the charm, the menace, the mystery. Megan Boone as Elizabeth Keen provides the FBI perspective. The guest criminals create variety. Spader's Reddington is television's most watchable mastermind.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The criminal underworld: the blacklist, the syndicates, the shadow organizations. The world expands across ten seasons—the Cabal, the Syndicate, Red's empire. The mythology becomes complex.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Network production: the FBI, the criminal operations, the international locations. The style is functional—Spader is the visual focus. The production serves the star.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is criminal operations: heists, assassinations, escapes. The blacklisters provide variety—each episode has a new criminal. Network TV action, not cinematic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Trust and manipulation, identity, whether people can change, the cost of secrets. The show explores these through Red's relationship with Elizabeth. The themes are present; the plot dominates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Blacklister of the week with serialized mystery: who is Red really? What's his connection to Elizabeth? The structure provides procedural reliability and serialized stakes. Spader keeps every episode watchable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ten seasons with conclusion. The Red-Elizabeth mystery resolved (controversially). The ending provided answers to decade-long questions. Complete, though opinions on the conclusion vary.</p>
