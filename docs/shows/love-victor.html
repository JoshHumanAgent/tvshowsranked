            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Creekwood High School. Victor Salazar moves from Texas to Atlanta with his family. His parents are religious; his new school has a kid named Benji who plays guitar in a coffee shop and is openly gay. Love, Simon's universe expanded: Victor's coming-out story, with all the fear, joy, and complication that involves. Michael Cimino is Victor; George Sear is Benji. High school romance with heart.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Michael Cimino captures the terror and excitement of first love. George Sear's Benji is the cool kid with depth. The supporting cast—Rachel Hilson as Mia, Anthony Turpel as Felix—creates the friend group. The family dynamics (Ana Ortiz, James Martinez as parents) ground the story in specific cultural context.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Suburban Atlanta high school: the coffee shop, the parties, the lockers, the specific pressures of a religious Latino family. The world expands across seasons—college applications, family businesses, the transition from high school. The setting is generic in outline but specific in execution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Hulu teen drama aesthetics: bright, appealing, the high school fantasy version of Atlanta. The style is functional—this is story-driven, not visual art. The romance is photographed warmly; the drama has appropriate weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. High school, houses, coffee shops. The "spectacle" is emotional—first kisses, coming-out scenes, family confrontations. Character-driven romance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Coming out, religion and sexuality, first love, family acceptance. The show explores what Love, Simon couldn't—the families who don't immediately accept, the intersection of Latino Catholic culture and queerness. The themes are handled with warmth but not unusual depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has Victor confronting new aspects: his sexuality, his boyfriend, his family, his future. The structure is classic high school drama—will they/won't they, family secrets revealed, prom approaches. Bingeable, satisfying, predictable in the best way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons with conclusion. Victor's story completes: his family, his relationship, his self-acceptance. The ending is hopeful without being saccharine. Complete and appropriate for the material.</p>
