## The Landscape

A funeral home in Los Angeles. Every episode opens with death—a stranger's death that somehow illuminates the Fishers' own struggles with life, love, and mortality. Alan Ball finds poetry in the business of endings.

## The Characters

Nate: the prodigal son returning to die. David: the closeted funeral director finding himself. Claire: the goth daughter growing into an artist. Ruth: the matriarch who never asked for any of this. Each Fisher wrestling with what it means to live while surrounded by death.

## What It Feels Like

Like a meditation on mortality that happens to be funny. Like understanding that death is both the end and the beginning of everything. Like spending five years with a family that becomes your own.

## The Finale

Six Feet and Flames—widely considered the greatest series finale ever made. Each character's ending revealed in montage. Life, death, and the space between. Prepare to weep.
