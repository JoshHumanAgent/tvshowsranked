## What It Feels Like to Watch

Every episode opens with death—a stranger's death that somehow illuminates the Fishers' own struggles with life, love, and mortality. A funeral home in Los Angeles becomes the setting for one of television's most profound explorations of what it means to live while constantly surrounded by death.

Nate Fisher is the prodigal son who returns home to his family's funeral home, only to face his own mortality when a brain aneurysm nearly kills him. His brother David runs the business but struggles with his sexuality and identity. Their sister Claire is the goth teenager who grows into an artist. And Ruth, their mother, never asked for any of this—she's a woman who buried a husband and is now running a funeral home with children who can't get along.

Alan Ball finds poetry in the business of endings. The show is funny—darkly so at times—and deeply moving. It teaches you about death by showing you how different people face it: with denial, with faith, with rage, with acceptance. And it shows that death isn't the opposite of life—it's woven into every moment of it.

The finale—"Six Feet Under and Flames"—is widely considered the greatest series finale ever made. Each character's ending is revealed in a beautiful montage that shows how each of them dies, and the final image of the Fisher family home burning while "I'll Fly Away" plays is unforgettable. It will make you weep. It'll make you understand something true about life.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 1.900**

**Strengths:**
- Peter Krause delivers a career-defining performance as Nate—the golden boy whose search for meaning leads him home, showing vulnerability and growth
- Michael C. Hall is extraordinary as David—his journey from closeted funeral director to confident gay man is handled with nuance and courage
- Lauren Ambrose brings depth to Claire, transforming from angry teenager to an artist who finds her voice
- Frances Conroy gives Ruth Fisher incredible complexity—a widow finding new purpose, new love, and new ways to be a mother
- Guest stars are remarkable: James Cromwell as Ruth's boyfriend, Bénedicte in the beautiful "The Curse of the Raven" episode

**Weaknesses:**
- Some characters in later seasons feel underserved (Brenda's storylines sometimes meander)
- The show occasionally relies on convenient plot devices

**Why 9.5 and not 10**: Nearly perfect ensemble work with exceptional performances. The only minor deduction for occasional unevenness in later character development.

---

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 1.350**

**Strengths:**
- The Fisher & Sons funeral home becomes a character itself—the preparation room, the viewing parlors, the crematorium
- Los Angeles is rendered beautifully—sun-bleached streets, the Forever Shangri-La cemetery, the Fisher home
- The business of death is portrayed with meticulous attention—embalming, cremation, body preparation, casket selection
- The show seamlessly integrates the living spaces (homes, offices) with the dead spaces (the funeral home)
- Supporting businesses and characters (the florist, the hospital, the church) create a complete ecosystem

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited geographic scope—almost entirely within LA
- Some secondary locations feel underdeveloped

**Why 9.0**: The funeral home world is created with love and detail. Every aspect of the business feels authentic.

---

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 8.8

**Raw Score: 8.8 | Weighted: 0.880**

**Strengths:**
- Gothic visual sensibility—dark interiors contrasted with LA sunlight
- Innovative opening sequences showing each episode's death in stylized fashion
- Beautiful use of shadows and candlelight in funeral scenes
- The signature "angel's eye view" overhead shots of the funeral home
- Visual storytelling that complements dialogue rather than relying on it

**Weaknesses:**
- Not as formally experimental as some HBO dramas
- Some episodes feel visually conventional

**Why 8.8**: Consistently beautiful with memorable visual moments. The opening death sequences are iconic.

---

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 8.2

**Raw Score: 8.2 | Weighted: 0.820**

**Strengths:**
- The funeral home is visually rich—coffins, flowers, gothic architecture
- Beautiful LA locations filmed with care—beaches, highways, suburban homes
- The finale's burning house is visually stunning
- Attention to detail in body preparation scenes—morbidly beautiful

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited "spectacle" in traditional sense—no action sequences or grand set pieces
- The show's power is in intimacy, not grandeur

**Why 8.2**: The spectacle is quiet—the beauty of a well-arranged funeral, the sunset over LA, the flames of the finale.

---

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 1.425**

**Strengths:**
- Profound meditation on mortality—what does it mean to face death every day?
- Exploration of family dynamics—the Fishers are dysfunctional in realistic ways
- Themes of faith vs. rationalism: Nate's journey from atheism to belief and back
- The show asks: what does it mean to live a meaningful life?
- Death is shown as natural, not scary—part of a cycle rather than an ending
- Examines grief, closure, and how different people process loss

**Weaknesses:**
- Some metaphysical elements (the "beyond" scenes) feel uneven in execution
- Abstract themes sometimes get lost in soap opera elements

**Why 9.5**: Few shows engage with mortality this directly. The conceptual richness is extraordinary.

---

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.275**

**Strengths:**
- Each episode has a complete story (the death of the week) while building toward larger arcs
- Strong season finales that pay off long-running storylines
- The mystery of Nate's survival and his relationship with Brenda/Claire drives seasons
- Characters make decisions that have real consequences
- The show balances episodic and serial storytelling masterfully

**Weaknesses:**
- Middle seasons occasionally lose momentum
- Some soap opera elements (Nate's various relationships) can feel repetitive

**Why 8.5**: Good pacing with satisfying payoffs. Not a thriller, but emotionally propulsive.

---

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 9.8

**Raw Score: 9.8 | Weighted: 1.470**

**Strengths:**
- "Six Feet Under and Flames" is universally considered the greatest series finale ever
- Each character receives a complete ending—even showing how each one dies
- Nate's final scene—being carried into the sea—is transcendent
- The montage structure showing each character's fate is devastating and beautiful
- Claire's final line ("I'll see you in my dreams") is perfect
- The ending provides closure while leaving room for interpretation
- "I'll Fly Away" playing over the burning house is one of TV's most powerful images

**Weaknesses:**
- Some might find showing all the deaths too much—though it's handled with grace
- A few minor storylines left unresolved

**Why 9.8**: Almost impossible to improve. The finale is a masterpiece of television storytelling.

## Why It Ranks #120

Six Feet Under is a masterwork of television that deals with mortality in ways no other show has attempted. The Fisher family becomes your family over five seasons, and their struggles with life, death, love, and identity are profound. Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, and the entire ensemble deliver performances that linger in memory. The world of the funeral home is rendered with gothic beauty, and the show's willingness to sit with death—to make it the subject rather than the obstacle—gives it unique power. And then there's the finale: "Six Feet Under and Flames" is not just the best ending in television history, it's a perfect statement on what it means to live knowing you will die. This is the show that proved television could do things film couldn't.
