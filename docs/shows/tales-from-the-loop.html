            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A town built above an underground physics facility that explores the impossible. Everyone in town has a connection to the Loop; the strange technology seeps into ordinary lives. Each episode is a standalone story—a robot wanting to be human, a woman unstuck in time, a boy who can stop time—grounded in Simon Stålenhag's atmospheric art. Science fiction as mood piece: melancholy, beautiful, human stories wrapped in technological strangeness.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode features different characters with the Loop as backdrop. The recurring cast (Jonathan Pryce, Jane Alexander, Paul Schneider) provides connective tissue. Guest actors carry individual episodes—some remarkable, others competent. The anthology format allows variety; consistency varies. The performances serve the atmosphere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Based on Simon Stålenhag's art: rural Scandinavia with massive machines half-buried, the Loop's facilities, ordinary houses with extraordinary basements. The world is specific—retro-futuristic, lived-in, melancholic. The technology is never explained; it just is. World-building as atmosphere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The show is visually stunning: Stålenhag's paintings translated to screen. Snow, rusted machines, amber light, the northern landscape. Each frame could be a painting. The visual style is the show's greatest achievement—sci-fi rendered as art film. Beautiful throughout.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is environmental: the machines, the Loop's interior, the town built on strangeness. The sci-fi elements are rendered with restraint—a robot, a time freeze, a body swap—effects serving character rather than overwhelming it. Subtle spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode explores a different theme: identity, memory, time, loss, the desire to escape or return. The sci-fi elements are metaphors for human concerns. The show rewards contemplation; the themes are present without being labored. Atmospheric philosophy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Anthology format: each episode is complete, connected only by location and recurring characters. The drive is episodic; there's no overarching plot. Viewers seeking momentum will be frustrated; viewers seeking mood will be satisfied. Deliberate pacing, slow rewards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight standalone episodes, each with resolution. The final episode connects threads but the show is designed as anthology—there's no single ending. Each story concludes appropriately. Complete as collection.</p>
