<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Monterey, California. Wealthy mothers, perfect lives, hidden bruises. Someone dies at school trivia night. Liane Moriarty's novel adapted by David E. Kelley: the mothers' secrets, the husbands' violence, the children who witness everything. Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley lead.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Reese Witherspoon as Madeline: the organizer, the meddler. Nicole Kidman as Celeste: the abused wife who doesn't see it. Shailene Woodley as Jane: the single mother with a secret. Laura Dern as Renata. The ensemble is HBO prestige at its finest.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Monterey: the beautiful houses, the ocean, the perfect schools, the violence behind closed doors. The world is wealth as prison—everything looks right, nothing is.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>HBO production: Monterey photographed as paradise, the houses, the ocean, the school. The style is beautiful surfaces hiding ugly truths.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the wealth: the houses, the clothes, the lifestyle. The "spectacle" is the truth emerging—watching perfect lives shatter.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Domestic violence, female friendship, protecting children, the lies we tell to keep up appearances, what happens when women support each other. The show explores these with depth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Someone died: the investigation reveals the secrets. Each episode is told through interview flash-forwards. The structure is mystery—who died, and why?</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
<p>Season 1 is complete perfection. Season 2 (with Meryl Streep) expands but feels unnecessary. The first season is the show. The death is revealed; the women unite.</p></div></section>
