            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Henry Tudor defeated Richard III at Bosworth. He marries Elizabeth of York to unite the warring houses. But is their marriage a union or a prison? Philippa Gregory's novel adapted for Starz: the aftermath of the Wars of the Roses, told through the women who survived.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jodie Comer as Elizabeth of York: caught between her Yorkist family and her Tudor husband. Jacob Collins-Levy as Henry VII: the victor uncertain of his throne. Michelle Fairley as Margaret Beaufort: the king's mother, terrifying in devotion. The performances capture the period tension.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Post-Bosworth England: the Tudor claim fragile, the Yorkist pretenders threatening, the queen caught between. The world is 15th-century political marriage—intimate and dangerous.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz production: Tudor England rendered with period detail, the marriage intimate, the politics claustrophobic. The style serves the drama—close quarters, whispered secrets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the court, the ceremonies, the occasional battle. This is political drama—not battles but marriages, negotiations, threats. Intimate historical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Political marriage vs. love, duty vs. family, what women owed to their houses vs. themselves, the cost of unifying enemies. The show explores these through Elizabeth's position.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The pretenders threaten Henry's throne; Elizabeth must choose between her Yorkist family and her Tudor husband. The structure is political thriller—loyalty constantly tested.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The pretender threat resolves; the marriage settles; the Tudor dynasty is secure. The ending provides historical closure while leaving emotional complexity.</p>
