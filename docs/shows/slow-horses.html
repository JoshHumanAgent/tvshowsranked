<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Slough House is where MI5 sends the screw-ups. Jackson Lamb is their drunk, brilliant, abusive boss. Gary Oldman is Lamb: the spy who doesn't care. Mick Herron's novels adapted: spy thriller as dark comedy, the rejects who keep saving the day.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Gary Oldman as Jackson Lamb: the grossness, the brilliance, the hidden decency. Jack Lowden as River Cartwright: the talented one who blew it. The ensemble creates the rejects. Oldman's Lamb is iconic.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Slough House: the dingy office, the rejected spies, the assignments nobody wants. The world is the opposite of MI5 glamour—this is where careers go to die.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Apple TV+ production: London photographed for spy thriller, Slough House rendered as dump. The style serves the premise—the rejects operate in the shadows.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is spy work: surveillance, action, the occasional gunfight. The "spectacle" is Lamb being terrible. Spy thriller with dark comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Failure vs. competence, bureaucracy vs. effectiveness, what we owe to colleagues, the secrets services keep. The show explores these through the rejects' work.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Each season is a mission: the slow horses prove themselves, Lamb saves them. The structure is spy thriller—the drive is the assignment.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>Ongoing. Three seasons complete, more planned. Each season resolves its mission; the characters continue. No endpoint.</p></div></section>
