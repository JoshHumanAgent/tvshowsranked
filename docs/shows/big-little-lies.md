## What It Feels Like to Watch

In the wealthy Monterey, California, community of Pebble Hill, three women — Madeline, Celeste, and Jane — become friends. Behind closed doors, however, they're hiding secrets: abuse, lies, and violence. Then a murder happens, and we learn who died — but the real question is who did it.

This is prestige television about the lives of wealthy women, and it's far better than it sounds. Created by David E. Kelley and based on Liane Moriarty's novel, the show explores domestic violence, female friendship, and the performances we put on for the world.

The cast is exceptional: Reese Witherspoon as the ambitious but vulnerable Madeline; Nicole Kidman as the glamorous but trapped Celeste; Shailene Woodley as the mysterious Jane; and Laura Dern as a investigator who sees through everyone's facade.

The first season is excellent — tight, suspenseful, and emotionally devastating. The second season, created after the show was renewed, is weaker but still watchable.

The show won multiple Emmys and launched a conversation about domestic violence. It's not perfect, but it's important.
