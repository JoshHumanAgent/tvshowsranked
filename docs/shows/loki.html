            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The Loki who escaped in Endgame is captured by the Time Variance Authority—an organization that monitors the sacred timeline. He's given a choice: be deleted, or help track down another Loki variant. Tom Hiddleston's Loki gets the spotlight: a god learning he's small, a villain learning he might be capable of growth. Marvel's most ambitious TV experiment: time travel, multiverse, and a trickster confronted with versions of himself.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Tom Hiddleston has played Loki for a decade; here he gets depth. Sophia Di Martino as Sylvie (a Loki variant) provides the mirror. Owen Wilson as Mobius is the bureaucrat who becomes a friend. Jonathan Majors as Kang (He Who Remains) appears in the finale. The performances elevate the concept.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The TVA: infinite offices, time doors, the sacred timeline, the variants. The world is distinctive—bureaucracy as cosmic order, analysts with neckties and infinity weapons. The Void, at the end of time, where pruned timelines go. Marvel's most interesting invention since Guardians.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Disney+ Marvel production: the TVA looks like brutalist architecture meets retro-futurism. The Void is apocalyptic landscape. The visual style is consistent with MCU while being distinctive. The action is staged for clarity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Marvel spectacle: time doors, timeline visualizations, the void at the end of time, Alioth the cloud monster. The TVA's scale is cosmic. The effects are film-quality; the vision is ambitious.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Free will vs. determinism, whether we can change who we are, the nature of the multiverse. The show explores these through Loki's character—a god of chaos who might want order, a villain who might want to be good. The philosophy is Marvel-level: present, not deep.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1: hunt the variant, discover the TVA's truth, confront Kang. Season 2: save the TVA, save the timeline, choose a path. The drive is propulsive—each episode advances understanding and stakes. Marvel pacing: momentum over depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, apparently complete. The ending provides Loki's arc conclusion while setting up multiversal consequences. Whether this continues is unclear; the story serves the larger MCU. Character resolution exists; franchise continuation required.</p>
