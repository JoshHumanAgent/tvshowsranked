            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Zelda Sayre before she was Zelda Fitzgerald: Southern belle, dancer, rebel. She meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance; their romance becomes legend. Christina Ricci is Zelda, David Hoflin is Scott, and 1920s Montgomery becomes the stage for one of literature's great doomed marriages. The beginning of everything: the Jazz Age, the excess, the talent and the madness that would consume them both.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Christina Ricci captures Zelda's wildness, her fear of being ordinary, her eventual instability. The performance is committed; the characterization leans into the myth. David Hoflin's Scott is the talented alcoholic she could neither live with nor without. The supporting cast represents the era's players.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Montgomery, Alabama, 1918: country clubs, debutantes, the South preparing for change. Then New York, Paris, the expatriate life. The world is accurate—the parties, the excess, the literary circles. Zelda's childhood South and her adult Europe both rendered with period detail.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Period drama aesthetics: costumes, sets, lighting. The style is functional without distinguishing. The glamour of the era is visible; the darkness underneath is suggested. Amazon production values in early streaming era.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: parties, dresses, the fountain-plunging that became legend. The production captures the Jazz Age's visual excess without emphasizing spectacle. This is a character study with period trappings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Talent and marriage, genius and rivalry, a woman overshadowed by her husband's legend. The show asks whether Zelda was insane or trapped, whether she chose her fate or had it chosen for her. The themes of the Fitzgeralds' marriage are present without deep exploration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The drive is the romance: will they, won't they, will it last? The episodes trace their meeting, marriage, and early celebrity. The pacing is deliberate; the pleasures are period and performance. Not propulsive, but engaging.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after two seasons. The show covers Zelda's youth and early marriage but not her later breakdown, institutionalization, and death. The title promises "the beginning of everything"; you see the beginning, not the end. Incomplete.</p>
