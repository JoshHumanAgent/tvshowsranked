## What It Feels Like to Watch

Seong Gi-hun is a divorced father deep in debt, struggling with gambling addiction and a failing relationship with his daughter. Then a strange man approaches him in a subway station, offers to play ddakji for money, and invites him to join a competition with a massive prize.

The games turn out to be deadly. Four hundred and fifty-six contestants play childhood games — red light green light, tug of war, marbles — for a prize of 45.6 billion won. The losers die.

*Squid Game* became a global phenomenon for good reason. The premise is instantly compelling: high-stakes competition mixed with childhood nostalgia, class critique wrapped in visceral entertainment. The production design is extraordinary — the games take place in surreal, colorful spaces that contrast horrifically with the violence.

Lee Jung-jae anchors the series as Gi-hun — a man who enters for the money but stays because he can't bear to let others die in his place. The supporting cast is equally strong, particularly Jung Ho-yeon as Kang Sae-byeok, a North Korean defector playing for her family, and O Yeong-su as Oh Il-nam, an elderly contestant who forms an unexpected bond with Gi-hun.

The show is unflinching about the brutality of its premise. People die horribly, often in front of friends. The games are designed to force moral compromises — betray your partner, sacrifice the weak, choose self-preservation over solidarity.

But it's the social commentary that lingers. The show argues that capitalism has already made life a death game for the poor — the literal competition is just making the stakes visible. The masked VIPs who watch the games, betting on human lives, are barely more monstrous than the real-world wealthy who profit from inequality.

The second season expands the world while maintaining the tension. Gi-hun returns, seeking revenge and justice, but the system is larger than one man.
