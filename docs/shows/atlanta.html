<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Earn manages his cousin Paper Boi, an emerging rapper. They navigate Atlanta's music scene, Black life, and surreal experiences that become normal. Donald Glover created the most original comedy of its decade: sometimes realistic, sometimes surreal, always specific.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Donald Glover as Earn: smart, broke, surviving. Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred/Paper Boi: the realist. Lakeith Stanfield as Darius: the visionary. Zazie Beetz as Van: the anchor who drifts. The performances are naturalistic and surreal.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>Atlanta: the city as character, the music scene, the Black American experience rendered in specificity. "Teddy Perkins," "B.A.N.," "Woods"—each episode creates its own world.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3><p>FX production: every episode looks different. "Fish Out of Water" directed by Hiro Murai. "Teddy Perkins" as horror. The style is experimental, beautiful, unsettling.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The Alligator Man, Teddy Perkins, invisible cars—the spectacle is surreal. The "spectacle" is the strangeness of Black life made visible.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Black identity, capitalism, art vs. commerce, family, what success costs. The show explores these through surrealism and realism, sometimes in the same episode.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Paper Boi's rise; Earn's hustle; Darius's visions; Van's path. The structure is episodic yet cumulative—each season adds to understanding.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Four seasons, complete. The final episode is perfect—Earn's choice, his growth, the ending earned. One of television's most original visions, concluded masterfully.</p></div></section>
