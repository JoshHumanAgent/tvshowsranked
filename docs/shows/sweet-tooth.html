            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A decade after the Great Crumble, hybrid children—part human, part animal—emerge. Gus is a boy with deer antlers, raised in isolation by his father. When his father dies, Gus ventures into a world that fears and hunts hybrids. Based on Jeff Lemire's comic, adapted into family-friendly post-apocalypse: wonder instead of grimdark, hope despite everything. The Last of Us for kids, or maybe what The Last of Us wishes it could feel.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Christian Convery as Gus is remarkable—innocent, curious, heartbreaking. Nonso Anozie as Big Man provides protection and moral complexity. Adeel Akhtar as the scientist searching for answers anchors the grown-up storyline. The child actors playing hybrids are uniformly good. The performances balance adventure tone with emotional weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Post-apocalyptic America: abandoned towns, nature reclaiming cities, militias hunting hybrids, the remnants of civilization. The show creates a complete world: the virus (the Sick), the hybrids, the competing factions. The world has rules and follows them. The production design is distinctive: colorful where similar shows go gray.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Beautiful wasteland: forests overgrowing highways, abandoned zoos, the Yellowstone preserve. The show is shot with fantasy-film quality; New Zealand doubles for America with gorgeous results. The cinematography creates wonder rather than despair. This is post-apocalypse as journey, not punishment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Hybrid children rendered with care: Gus's antlers, the pig-boy's snout, the wolf-pup's features. The animal-human combinations are believable without being grotesque. The spectacle includes action sequences, animal attacks, militia battles. Production value shows on screen.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Nature's response to humanity, the fear of difference, family found and lost. The show explores why some fear hybrids (are they the cause or result of the virus?) while others protect them. The themes are present but gentle—this is adventure first, allegory second. Appropriate for younger viewers without being juvenile.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Gus's journey to find his mother provides the spine; multiple storylines converge across seasons. The show balances episodic adventures with serialized momentum. Each episode ends with progress; each season builds toward larger revelations. Compulsive viewing for families and adults alike.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The mystery of the hybrids and the Sick continues to unfold. Whether the showrunners have an ending planned is unclear. The tone and quality remain consistent; trajectory feels positive. Unresolved but promising.</p>
