## What It Feels Like to Watch

Barry Berkman is a hitman from the Midwest who travels to Los Angeles to kill someone — but instead, he stumbles into an acting class and discovers he might want to be an actor instead.

This is the most unlikely premise for a show — and the most compelling. Bill Hader is extraordinary as Barry — a man who is terrible at being a person but might be talented at performing one. The supporting cast includes Henry Winkler as the acting teacher who doesn't know his student is a murderer.

The show is brutal. The violence is sudden and devastating. But it's also hilarious — the contrast between the darkness of Barry's work and the earnestness of his acting classmates creates comedy that's genuinely funny.

The show evolved over four seasons, exploring themes of identity, redemption, and the cost of violence. It won multiple Emmys, including Outstanding Comedy Series, and it's one of the most acclaimed shows of recent years.
