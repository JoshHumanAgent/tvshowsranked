            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">All of Us Are Dead is a Korean zombie series set almost entirely within a high school, and the confinement is the point. When an outbreak begins, a group of students finds themselves trapped in a building with classmates who are transforming, and the show extracts maximum tension from the particular dynamics of Korean school life: the cliques, the bullying, the social hierarchies that determine who gets saved and who gets sacrificed.</p>

            <p>The zombies are fast and aggressive, but the show's real interest is in how quickly social order collapses under pressure. The students who were powerful before—class presidents, bullies, athletes—find their status meaningless when survival depends on physical capability and moral flexibility rather than grades and family connections. The show doesn't shy away from brutality: characters die, sometimes shockingly, and the threat feels genuine because no one is safe.</p>

            <p>Where the series struggles is in its expansion beyond the school. The first half, confined to the building, is claustrophobic horror at its best. The second half opens up to the broader outbreak, government response, and family drama, diluting the intensity that made the early episodes work. The ending sets up a second season that may or may not come, and the lack of resolution limits the satisfaction of the journey. But for pure zombie action with genuine stakes and a setting that provides fresh dynamics, All of Us Are Dead delivers the goods.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>All of Us Are Dead earns its ranking through intense first-half execution and a setting that reinvigorates zombie tropes. The score reflects a show that's strongest when confined and less sure-footed when it expands its scope.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The student ensemble captures adolescent social dynamics under extreme pressure—friendships that strengthen, rivalries that become deadly, crushes that persist even as the world ends. The performances are natural for the age, avoiding the trap of adults playing teenagers awkwardly. Some characters develop meaningfully; others exist primarily as zombie fodder.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The high school becomes a fully realized environment—classrooms, laboratories, roof access, the particular geography that determines who can escape where. The outbreak's origin in a science lab provides a familiar but effective setup. The broader world beyond the school is less developed, and the show is better when it stays contained.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach emphasizes the chaos of the outbreak—handheld cameras racing through hallways, close-ups of faces contorting in transformation, the particular horror of seeing people you know become something else. The school setting provides both visual variety and claustrophobic constraint.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The zombie effects are convincing, and the action sequences maintain clarity despite their intensity. The spectacle is in the sheer number of zombies and the creative ways the students find to survive. The school becomes a battleground with set pieces that use the environment effectively.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show uses zombie apocalypse as a lens for adolescent social dynamics—bullies discovering that physical dominance matters less than tactical thinking, unpopular students finding purpose, crushes expressed through protection rather than words. The class commentary is present but not extensively developed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The first half is relentless—survival from moment to moment, the threat constant and evolving. The pacing maintains urgency across extended running time. The second half slows as the scope expands, but the momentum carries. The show knows how to sustain tension across episodes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending is inconclusive, clearly designed for continuation rather than completion. Characters survive in uncertain circumstances, and the outbreak's broader implications are left unexplored. For viewers seeking a complete story, this is frustrating; for those willing to invest in an ongoing series, it's acceptable.</p>
