            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A sound designer discovers a frequency that affects human behavior. A shadowy organization wants it. She goes on the run. Sound as weapon, conspiracy thriller, one woman against the system. Minimalist thriller where what you hear matters as much as what you see.
            </p>

                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is audio: the frequency, its effects, the manipulation. This is thriller with sound weapon—not visual spectacle but sensory experience.</p>

                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Sound as control, the weaponization of technology, conspiracy and resistance, what we perceive vs. what's real. The show explores these through the audio thriller premise.</p>
