            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Jimmy is a therapist grieving his wife. He decides to tell his patients exactly what he thinks—no more therapeutic boundaries. Jason Segel plays Jimmy with the warmth of a man drowning. Harrison Ford is Paul, his colleague, a senior therapist with Parkinson's who won't discuss it. The show is grief comedy: funny without dismissing sadness, therapeutic without being therapy. From Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein: Ted Lasso's healing energy applied to loss.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Jason Segel is perfect: grieving, impulsive, trying to help and making messes. Harrison Ford as Paul is gruff, stubborn, vulnerable without being soft. Jessica Williams as Gaby brings energy. Christa Miller as Liz provides the neighborhood chaos. The ensemble chemistry is immediate and real.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Suburban LA therapy practice: the office, the neighborhood, the patients. The patients (particularly Jimmy's cases) provide external stories. Paul's Parkinson's creates a medical world. The world is functional, supporting character rather than demanding attention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ polish: clean, bright, professional. The visual style serves comedy and drama without distinguishing. The California light supports the tone—this is sad but not dark.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is therapy in offices, conversations in backyards. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching someone break through or break down. Character-driven dramedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, therapy ethics, whether honesty is the same as healing, the boundaries professionals impose on themselves. Jimmy breaks the rules and sometimes helps, sometimes hurts. The show explores whether "telling people what to do" is therapeutic. Smart without being academic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode has cases-of-the-week and serialized character arcs. Jimmy's relationship with his daughter, Paul's Parkinson's, the patients' progress. The drive is emotional momentum—will these people heal? Light binging, satisfying half-hours.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Season 2 continues development. The show doesn't appear to have a predetermined endpoint. Currently delivering quality comedy-drama without clear conclusion timeline.</p>
