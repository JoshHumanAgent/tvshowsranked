<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A professional translator falls in love with a CEO who speaks a language she doesn't know. The show is Korean rom-com through a linguistic lens—misunderstandings across languages become plot points. Park Ji-hoon plays the multilingual CEO; Shin Hyun-been is the translator who can read documents better than people. Lost in Translation meets Korean drama: language barriers become romantic tension. The show explores translation theory—the gap between literal meaning and emotional truth—while delivering romance beats. The leads have chemistry, the comedy is light, the romance is earnest.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3><p>Shin Hyun-been's translator is competent, overworked, and socially awkward—romance-comedy lead. Park Ji-hoon's CEO is competent but lonely, multilingual but isolated. The acting is K-rom-com standard with enough charm.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (6/10)</h3><p>Korean corporate translation world: agencies, conferences, business meetings. The multilingual environment is specific. The gap between professional competence and personal connection is the premise.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>K-rom-com aesthetic: soft focus, bright colors, emotional close-ups. Language and translation are visualized through text overlays. The visual style is effective.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. Translation offices, conference rooms, coffee meetings. The "visuals" are acting and language.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Language and connection. Can love exist without shared language? The gap between words and feelings. Translation theory is metaphor for cross-cultural romance. The themes are literal—words—and applicable—relationships.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Professional interactions become personal. Misunderstandings escalate then resolve. The sixteen-episode structure builds romance through work and life.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Complete romance. Language barriers become bridges. Standard K-drama romance ending—happy, complete, satisfying.</p></div></section>
