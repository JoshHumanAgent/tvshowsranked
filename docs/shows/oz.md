## What It Feels Like to Watch

Oz is a gritty, unflinching look at prison life that pulled no punches. Set in the fictional Emerald City prison, it presents a world of violence, corruption, and moral compromise with raw honesty.

You watch Oz and feel the claustrophobia. These men are trapped—in cells, in institutions, in their own worst impulses. The show doesn't romanticize anyone. The guards are as corrupt as the prisoners. The system is broken.

The series is experimental in its storytelling—narrated by the warden, structured like theater with acts, pushing the boundaries of what network television could show.

But Oz is more than shock value. It's a serious exploration of what happens when you strip away society's rules. How do people survive? How do they maintain humanity? What do they become?
