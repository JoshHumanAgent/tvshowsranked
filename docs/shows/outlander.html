            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1945: Claire Randall, a combat nurse, touches standing stones in Scotland and falls through time to 1743. She meets Jamie Fraser, a Highlander, and must navigate a world on the brink of Jacobite rebellion. Diana Gabaldon's novels adapted into television: time travel, passionate romance, historical accuracy, brutal violence. Claire and Jamie's love story spans centuries, continents, and impossible circumstances. The show that made kilts sexy again.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Caitríona Balfe as Claire is fierce, intelligent, modern in a pre-modern world. Sam Heughan as Jamie is the romantic ideal: strong, principled, damaged, devoted. The chemistry between them is legendary. The supporting cast rotates across seasons—historical figures, villains, family—maintaining quality. The performances sell the improbable premise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1740s Scotland rendered in forensic detail: Highland life, clan politics, the Stuart cause, English occupation. Then Paris, then America, each location with equal specificity. The historical research is visible without being academic. The time travel is mechanism, not focus—the past is where the story lives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz production values: Scotland is beautiful, period detail is precise, the scale is epic. The show looks expensive without being ostentatious. The battle sequences are staged with impact; the intimate scenes are photographed with care. Television that looks like film.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is historical: battles, estates, costumes, the Scottish Highlands. The production value is visible. The violence is brutal—Culloden, Wentworth Prison. The spectacle serves the story; the romance is the heart.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Love across time, the inevitability of history, the cost of knowledge. Claire knows the Jacobite rebellion will fail; she can't prevent it. The show explores fate vs. agency, the weight of loving someone you can't protect from history. The themes are present; the romance is primary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season adapts a novel: Scotland, Paris, America, and beyond. The drive is the romance and survival—will Claire and Jamie be together, will they survive history's violence. The pacing varies; some seasons are slower than others. But the central relationship maintains investment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues adapting Gabaldon's novels. Each season resolves its arc while setting up the next. Whether the complete story will be told depends on renewal. Currently delivering quality without finality.</p>
