            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A graphic novel called "The Utopia Experiments" predicts disasters. A conspiracy connects the comic to real events. A group of fans who met online find themselves hunted by the Network, a shadowy organization that wants the manuscript's secrets. Dennis Kelly's UK original: neon-yellow violence, brutal humor, conspiracy thriller as art film. Not for the faint-hearted.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The ensemble creates distinct personalities: Ian, Becky, Wilson, Grant, and the mysterious Jessica. Neil Maskell as Arby is terrifying—a killer who doesn't understand his own violence. The performances match the show's intensity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The Network: a conspiracy that spans government, pharmaceutical, and media institutions. The comic book that predicts the future. The world is paranoid and plausible—a world where everything is connected and nothing is what it seems. The mythology is complete and consistent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Distinctive doesn't begin to describe it: neon-yellow and deep-blue palette, graphic novel composition, violence that's simultaneously beautiful and repulsive. The visual language is unlike anything else on television. The style IS the substance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is violence: stylized, brutal, shocking. The killings are staged as art—color-coordinated, choreographed, unforgettable. The spectacle is designed to disturb. Not for everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Conspiracy, the manipulation of populations, whether knowing the truth is worth the cost, the ethics of violence for survival. The show explores paranoia as a worldview—and then asks if the paranoid are right. Dense and disturbing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Relentless: the Network hunts, the fans run, the conspiracy reveals itself layer by layer. The pacing is brutal—no time to recover between revelations. Every episode ends with escalation. Designed for binge-watching.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, complete. The conspiracy resolves; the truth is revealed. The ending is controversial—some found it satisfying, others felt it betrayed the premise. The American remake (Amazon) failed to capture the original's brilliance.</p>
