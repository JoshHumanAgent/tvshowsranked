<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Felicity follows Ben to college. She barely knows him. She made a decision based on a note in his yearbook. Keri Russell is Felicity: making impulsive choices and living with them. JJ Abrams and Matt Reeves created the college drama: growing up happens after high school.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Keri Russell as Felicity: earnest, searching, real. Scott Speedman as Ben, Scott Foley as Noel. The love triangle that mattered.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>NYU (fictional as "UNY"): the dorms, the city, college life. The world is young adulthood in New York.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>90s WB production: New York City, college dorms, the visual style of intimate drama.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is college students figuring out life. The spectacle is growth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Identity, choices, who we become in late adolescence. The show explored coming of age with unusual depth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Ben vs. Noel. Finding yourself. College drama structure with real stakes.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Four seasons, complete. The infamous time travel ending divides fans but provides closure. Unique conclusion.</p></div></section>
