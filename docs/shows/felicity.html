            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Felicity is a coming-of-age drama about a young woman who follows her high school crush across the country to college, abandoning her parents' plans for Stanford in favor of NYU. The premise sounds like a romantic comedy setup, but the show takes Felicity's choice seriously: this isn't about the boy, it's about a young woman making her first independent decision and discovering that independence is harder than declaration. Keri Russell plays Felicity with an openness that makes every emotional beat feel immediate.</p>

            <p>The show aired from 1998 to 2002, capturing the turn-of-the-millennium moment when young adulthood felt like a series of life-defining choices. Felicity navigates romantic triangles, career uncertainty, and the gradual realization that adult life doesn't resolve—the questions just change. The famous hair-cutting moment in season two, when Felicity shears off her signature curls, became a cultural touchstone because it symbolized the show's willingness to change its own identity.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes Felicity from other teen dramas of its era is its patience. Co-creator J.J. Abrams, before he became synonymous with mystery-box storytelling, built a show that lived in emotional moments rather than plot twists. The romantic triangle between Felicity, Ben, and Noel is resolved and reopened multiple times across four seasons, but each iteration reveals something new about the characters involved. The show trusts that young people's feelings are worth taking seriously, even when those feelings are about decisions that won't ultimately matter.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Felicity earns its ranking through emotional authenticity and Keri Russell's star-making performance. The show captures a specific moment in young adulthood with patience and care. The score reflects a teen drama that transcends its genre.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Keri Russell carries the show with emotional immediacy that never feels performed. The supporting cast creates distinct personalities—Scott Speedman's Ben, Scott Foley's Noel—each representing different aspects of what Felicity might want. The acting serves the emotional truth rather than theatrical moments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>NYU and New York provide backdrop for college life, but the show's world is primarily emotional—relationships, dorms, apartments where people process feelings. The setting serves the story without overwhelming it. The time capsule feel of late-90s college life is present but not emphasized.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Standard television direction of its era—functional rather than distinctive. The visual style serves the emotional content without calling attention to itself. Some episodes experiment with format, particularly the experimental final season.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is a relationship drama shot in apartments and coffee shops. The visual interest is entirely in faces and emotional reactions. The show's ambitions are interior rather than exterior.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show treats young adult decision-making seriously—the weight of choosing a college, a major, a partner, when none of these choices feel reversible. The exploration of how people become themselves is genuine, if not intellectually sophisticated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The romantic triangle provides momentum, but the show's pace is slow by contemporary standards—episodes where not much happens except people processing feelings. This is appropriate to the material but requires investment in the characters.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The final season experiments with time travel in a way that divides viewers, but the emotional resolution feels earned. Felicity makes her final romantic choice, and the show ends with appropriate closure. Some threads are left hanging, but the central question of who Felicity will become is answered.</p>
