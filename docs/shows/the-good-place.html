<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Eleanor Shellstrop has died. She's in the Good Place. Except she wasn't good—she was a terrible person who doesn't belong. Michael Schur created sitcom as philosophy: ethics made comedy, the afterlife as character study.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Kristen Bell as Eleanor: terrible person learning better. Ted Danson as Michael: the architect revealed. William Jackson Harper as Chidi: ethics professor made real. The performances ground the absurdity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>The Good Place (and Bad Place): the neighborhood, the rules, the point system, the afterlife bureaucracy. The world is philosophy made visual—every detail has purpose.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Bright colors, suburban utopia, the visual language of heaven made sitcom. The style serves the premise.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the afterlife: demons, voids, the judge. But mostly this is people talking in a neighborhood.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Ethics, redemption, whether people can change, what we owe to each other, the meaning of eternal life. The show is philosophy made accessible.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Each season reinvents itself; the twists are planned. The drive is understanding—what is this place, why am I here, can I be better?</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Four seasons, complete. The ending is perfect—philosophers get their answer. One of the best series finales ever made.</p></div></section>
