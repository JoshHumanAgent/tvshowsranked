            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher—a mutated monster hunter for hire. Yennefer of Vengerberg is a sorceress with a traumatic past. Ciri is a princess with mysterious powers. Their stories intertwine across timelines. Henry Cavill is Geralt—gravelly, honorable, surprisingly funny. Andrzej Sapkowski's novels adapted for the Game of Thrones audience: monsters, politics, destiny.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Henry Cavill embodies Geralt: the physical presence, the dry humor, the unexpected warmth. Anya Chalotra as Yennefer is fierce and damaged. Freya Allan as Ciri grows into the role. The ensemble captures Sapkowski's characters. (Cavill departed after season 3; Liam Hemsworth takes over.)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Continent: monsters, sorcerers, kingdoms, destiny. The world is rendered with Netflix budget—cities, battles, magical effects. The non-linear timeline (season 1) confused some viewers; the world is richest when you understand it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix fantasy production: the monsters are varied, the battles are staged with scale, the magic is visible. The style distinguishes it from Game of Thrones—more colorful, more magical, less historically grounded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is fantasy: monsters, battles, magic. Geralt's contracts provide monster-of-the-week structure. The battles are staged with budget. The spectacle serves the world-building.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Destiny, the lesser evil, whether monsters are humans, neutrality in a world that demands sides. The themes are present in Sapkowski's work; the show explores them episodically. The philosophy is secondary to the action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1's non-linear structure confuses some; seasons 2-3 are more straightforward. The drive is Geralt and Ciri's destiny, Yennefer's arc, the political conflicts. The pacing is episodic monster-slaying with serialized plot.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Season 3 concluded the Cavill era; the show continues with Hemsworth. The endpoint is uncertain—Sapkowski's novels provide material for more seasons. Currently in transition.</p>
