<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Jessica Day moves into a loft with three guys after a bad breakup. She's whimsical; they're not. Zooey Deschanel is the New Girl who changes them. Elizabeth Meriwether created network comfort food: friendships that become family, weirdness that becomes normal.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Zooey Deschanel as Jess: quirky made appealing. Jake Johnson as Nick: the grump who loves her. Max Greenfield as Schmidt: the best/worst. Lamorne Morris as Winston: prankster. The ensemble chemistry carried seven seasons.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>The loft: the four friends, the bar, the relationships. The world is found family—strangers who become essential.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>Network multicam: bright lights, studio audience, the visual language of sitcoms. Functional, not distinctive.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is people in a loft talking and dating. The "spectacle" is how much you care.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3><p>Friendship, romance, growing up in your 30s. Light themes explored through comedy. Comfort viewing.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3><p>Will they/won't they with Nick and Jess. The structure is sitcom episodic with serialized romance.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Seven seasons, complete. Nick and Jess resolve. The group stays together. Satisfying ending to a comfort show.</p></div></section>
