            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Louise is a single mother who begins an affair with her boss, David. She also befriends his wife, Adele. Neither knows about the other. As Louise learns more about Adele and David's past, the story twists into unexpected territory. Sarah Pinborough's novel adapted: a thriller that starts as one thing and becomes another. The ending is notorious.

                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the twist: what seems like psychological thriller becomes something with supernatural implications. The "spectacle" is narrative—audience realization.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Obsession, manipulation, the stories we tell ourselves, whether we can truly know others. The themes are present but the twist is the priority. Discussion of the ending dominates conversation.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The ending is the point—controversial, divisive, unforgettable. The show is designed for the twist; the twist is designed for conversation. Whether it works depends on the viewer's tolerance for the supernatural.</p>
