            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1960s China: a woman makes a decision that will echo for centuries. Present day: scientists are killing themselves. A VR game leads players to a civilization with three suns—unstable, chaotic, dying. An alien fleet is coming, and humanity has 400 years to prepare. Cixin Liu's novel adapted by Game of Thrones creators: hard science fiction with human drama, cosmic stakes, and the question of whether humanity deserves to survive.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The ensemble includes Eiza González, Jovan Adepo, Liam Cunningham, and Benedict Wong. The characters serve the science—they're vectors for concepts rather than fully realized people. The acting is competent; the material prioritizes ideas over emotion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The three-body system is rendered in VR: a civilization that plays games with orbital mechanics, that evolves and dies in cycles. The physics are accurate; the stakes are cosmic. The Earth-side world of present-day academia, UN councils, and secret organizations is built with equal care. Science fiction world-building at its most ambitious.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production values: the VR sequences are distinctive, the three-sun animation is beautiful, the present-day scenes are polished. The visual style serves the science—clarity over artistry. The cosmic imagery is genuinely impressive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The VR game, the three suns, the alien fleet, the orbital mechanics made visible. The spectacle is intellectual—watching civilizations rise and fall in chaotic orbits, watching humanity confront its cosmic insignificance. The effects are film-quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Fermi paradox, orbital mechanics, game theory, the sociology of contact, whether humanity should survive, whether it's rational to help an alien invasion. The show respects the science and explores the philosophy. Among TV's most intellectually dense offerings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The mystery unfolds: what's killing scientists, what's the game, what's coming. The pacing is deliberate—this is hard sci-fi, not action. The drive is understanding; patient viewers rewarded, others may find it slow. The structure alternates timelines: 1960s and present day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Season 1 establishes the premise; the alien fleet is 400 years away. The story requires multiple seasons. Whether Netflix commits to the full trilogy is uncertain. Currently promising but incomplete.</p>
