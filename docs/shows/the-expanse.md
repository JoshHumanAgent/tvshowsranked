## The Landscape

Two hundred years in the future: Earth, Mars, and the Belters who mine the asteroid belt. Hard science fiction that respects physics and gravity. Political thriller disguised as space opera. The protomolecule arrives, and everything changes.

## The Characters

Jim Holden: the idealist who keeps making things worse. Naomi Nagata: the Belter engineer who bridges worlds. Amos: the sociopath with a code. Detective Miller: the noir protagonist in a space suit. Bobbie Draper: the Martian marine who questions everything.

## What It Feels Like

Like Game of Thrones in space, but smarter. Like watching a show that believes in its audience's intelligence. The fan campaign that saved it from cancellation—because some stories deserve to be finished.

## Hard Sci-Fi

This isn't Star Wars with space wizards. This is gravity, politics, and the physics of space travel. It respects the genre by making the science matter.
