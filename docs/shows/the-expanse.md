## The Landscape

Two hundred years in the future: Earth, Mars, and the Belters who mine the asteroid belt. Hard science fiction that respects physics and gravity. Political thriller disguised as space opera. The protomolecule arrives, and everything changes.

## The Characters

Jim Holden: the idealist who keeps making things worse. Naomi Nagata: the Belter engineer who bridges worlds. Amos: the sociopath with a code. Detective Miller: the noir protagonist in a space suit. Bobbie Draper: the Martian marine who questions everything.

## What It Feels Like

Like Game of Thrones in space, but smarter. Like watching a show that believes in its audience's intelligence. The fan campaign that saved it from cancellation—because some stories deserve to be finished.

## Hard Sci-Fi

This isn't Star Wars with space wizards. This is gravity, politics, and the physics of space travel. It respects the genre by making the science matter.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.70**

**Strengths:**
- **Jim Holden (Steven Strait)**: The idealist who keeps making things worse. His moral compass is both his strength and weakness.
- **Naomi Nagata (Nadine Velazquez/Strand)**: The Belter engineer who bridges worlds. Her relationship with Amos is the heart of the show.
- **Amos (Wes Chatham)**: The sociopath with a code. Chatham brings unexpected warmth to this dangerous character.
- **Thomas Jane**Detective Miller (): The noir protagonist in a space suit. Jane is magnificent—wry, worn, and ultimately heroic.
- **Bobbie Draper (Frankie Adams)**: The Martian marine who questions everything. A warrior's journey through political betrayal.
- **Avasarala (Shohreh Aghdashloo)**: The politician who tells hard truths. Aghdashloo is a scene-stealer.

**Weaknesses:**
- Holden can be frustratingly naive.
- Some supporting characters underutilized in later seasons.

**Why 8.5 not 9.0**: Excellent ensemble, but Holden's persistent idealism wears thin at times.
