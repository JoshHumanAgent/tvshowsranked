            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Raylan Givens is a US Marshal with a quick draw and a dark past. He's reassigned to Kentucky, the land of his upbringing, where his ex-wife works, his criminal father lives, and everyone knows everyone. Elmore Leonard's creation adapted for television: modern Western, Southern noir, criminals who talk, lawmen who shoot. Timothy Olyphant wears the hat; Walton Goggins steals every scene as Boyd Crowder. The best crime show you might have missed.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Timothy Olyphant IS Raylan Givens: laconic, dangerous, morally flexible. Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder is among television's great antagonists—criminal, preacher, philosopher, Raylan's dark mirror. The supporting cast (Joelle Carter, Nick Searcy, Jacob Pitts, Erica Tazel) creates a complete ecosystem. The guest villains each season are unforgettable: Mags Bennett, Quarles, Avery Markham. Casting perfection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Harlan County, Kentucky: coal mines, meth labs, family feuds, a code of honor that predates America. The show creates a complete region—the same families, the same grudges, everyone connected. Leonard's Florida crime adapted to Appalachian poverty. Specific, credible, lived-in.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Modern Western aesthetics: the hat, the draw, the landscape. Kentucky is photographed beautifully—the hills, the hollows, the small towns. The style is clean, functional, appropriate. The direction serves the dialogue, which deserves serving.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is gunplay: quick draws, standoffs, the violence Raylan carries with him. But spectacle isn't the point—dialogue and character are. The "spectacle" is watching criminals talk, watching Raylan and Boyd circle each other, watching words become threats.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Law and crime as family history, the impossibility of escaping your roots, the thin line between marshal and outlaw. Raylan and Boyd were coal miners together; now one wears a badge, one runs crime. The show explores redemption and its limits. Elmore Leonard's moral complexity adapted perfectly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic cases with serialized arcs: each season has a villain, each episode has a crime, and Raylan's history with Harlan deepens throughout. The balance between case-of-the-week and ongoing story is perfect. The drive is constant; the payoffs are satisfying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Six seasons with planned conclusion. The final season brings Raylan, Boyd, and Ava to the reckoning the show always promised. The ending respects every character. Raylan doesn't get everything he wants; Boyd doesn't get what he deserves. Perfect Western conclusion.</p>
