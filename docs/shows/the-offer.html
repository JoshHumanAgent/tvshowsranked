            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Albert S. Ruddy produced The Godfather. This is the story of how that happened: the fights with Paramount, the mob threats, the casting battles, the making of a masterpiece. Miles Teller is Ruddy. Matthew Goode is Robert Evans. Juno Temple is Bettye McCartt. The making-of movie becomes the movie.

            <div class="dimension">

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1970s Hollywood: Paramount Pictures, the Godfather sets, the mob connections. The world is built with detail—the offices, the restaurants, the backlots. Hollywood history comes alive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Paramount+ production: 1970s Hollywood recreated with care. The Godfather sets are rebuilt. The style is nostalgic—warm, grainy, Hollywood golden. The aesthetic is the memory of movies.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is behind-the-scenes: the casting, the fights, the mob threats. This is Hollywood business rendered as thriller. The "spectacle" is watching The Godfather take shape.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Art vs. commerce, compromise vs. vision, the cost of greatness, the role of producers. The show explores these through Ruddy's struggle to make The Godfather. The themes are present but secondary to the entertainment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Can they make the movie? Each episode presents a new obstacle: the mob, the studio, the budget, the director. The structure is obstacle-overcome-escalation. The drive is will-they-won't-they-make-it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The Godfather gets made; the obstacles are overcome; Ruddy wins. The ending is predetermined—The Godfather exists—but the journey is entertaining.</p>
