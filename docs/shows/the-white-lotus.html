            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">The White Lotus is a satire about rich people on vacation, and it is sharper and funnier than that description suggests. Each season is set in a different White Lotus resort—Hawaii, Sicily, Thailand—where wealthy guests and the staff who serve them collide in ways that expose class, race, and the particular entitlement of people who've never been told no. Mike White writes and directs with a satirist's fury and a humanist's eye for the specific unhappiness that wealth cannot cure.</p>

            <p>The first season follows several guest groups over a week: a honeymoon couple whose marriage is already fraying, a family whose material success has papered over emotional vacancy, a woman grieving her mother's death with her mother's ashes in a bag. The staff are drawn with equal specificity—the manager whose professional hospitality masks contempt, the spa worker whose kindness is genuine until it isn't. Everybody wants something, and everybody is disappointed. The vacation setting makes visible what daily life conceals.</p>

            <p>What elevates The White Lotus above standard rich-people satire is its precision. These aren't caricatures of privilege; they're individuals whose specific forms of unhappiness are generated by their specific forms of advantage. The second season shifts to Sicily and adds sexuality and colonialism to the class exploration, with guest actors who commit to making privileged people recognizably human. The show's genius is in making you understand people you'd probably avoid, then showing you that understanding them doesn't mean forgiving them. Death hangs over each season, but the real darkness is quotidian: the ways we disappoint each other, the failures that happen in paradise.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>The White Lotus earns its ranking through Mike White's writing, ensemble commitment, and a satirical vision that's angry without being simplistic. The score reflects television that uses comedy to tell truths that drama couldn't reach.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season features different actors, and the quality is consistent: performances that find humanity in privilege without excusing it. Jennifer Coolidge became the show's signature—a wealthy woman whose neediness is both comic and tragic. Every character is specific, complicated, and precisely calibrated to satirize their class position.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The resorts are rendered with attention to how service workers manage the expectations of people who've never been denied. The geography of each location creates natural proximity—the way pools and dining areas force people into interaction. The world is closed enough to create pressure, open enough to feel like vacation.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The seasons have distinct visual identities—Hawaii tropical, Sicily ancient and sun-bleached, Thailand verdant. Each resort feels like a version of paradise, and the visual style highlights what paradise costs: labor, intrusion, the pretense that everyone's happy. The direction captures performances without overwhelming them.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is environmental—the beauty of locations that guests take for granted and staff maintain. There are no action sequences or effects. The visual interest is in watching people reveal themselves in spaces where they're supposed to be relaxed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages seriously with class, privilege, and the particular emptiness that material success can't fill. The guests' problems are real despite their wealth; the staff's problems are complicated by proximity to money. Neither side is vilified or valorized; everyone is specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season opens with a death, then rewinds to show how we arrived. The mystery structure creates tension without being the point—knowing someone dies makes every interaction potentially significant. The weekly structure provides natural progression.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season resolves its central mystery while leaving character relationships open enough to feel true. The deaths feel inevitable in retrospect rather than arbitrary; the climaxes emerge from character logic. White resists easy endings—people learn things about themselves, but learning isn't the same as changing.</p>
