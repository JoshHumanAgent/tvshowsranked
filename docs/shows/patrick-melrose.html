<h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>

<p>Patrick Melrose premiered on Showtime on May 12, 2018, created by David Nicholls from Edward St Aubyn's semi-autobiographical novels. The five-episode limited series stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Patrick Melrose, an aristocratic Englishman struggling with addiction, trauma, and the legacy of childhood abuse. Each episode adapts one of St Aubyn's five novels, spanning Patrick's life from the 1960s to the 2000s, depicting his journey from drug-addled despair toward recovery and self-understanding.</p>

<p>The series is a devastating portrait of trauma and addiction, elevated by Cumberbatch's extraordinary performance and the source material's literary quality. St Aubyn's novels, based on his own experiences of childhood sexual abuse by his father, provide unflinching material that the series handles with sensitivity and artistic ambition. This is not easy viewing—it depicts drug use, abuse, and psychological damage with raw honesty—but it is profoundly moving and ultimately hopeful.</p>

<p>Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Patrick Melrose is a career peak—a display of technical virtuosity and emotional rawness that spans the character's entire adult life. In Episode 1 "Bad News," Cumberbatch depicts Patrick at his lowest—coked out of his mind, desperate, self-loathing, yet somehow maintaining a sardonic wit. Cumberbatch reportedly prepared by consulting with recovering addicts and even briefly experimented with the physicality of cocaine use (without taking the drug) to capture Patrick's twitchy desperation. The performance is physically demanding and emotionally exhausting.</p>

<p>Across the five episodes, Cumberbatch ages Patrick from the 1980s to the 2000s, depicting his journey from addiction to recovery, from denial to acknowledgment of his abuse, from self-destruction to tentative hope. Episode 2 "Never Mind" flashes back to Patrick's childhood at the family's French estate, with Sebastian Maltby playing young Patrick and Hugo Weaving as his monstrous father David. Episode 3 "Some Hope" depicts a house party where Patrick confronts his past. Episode 4 "Mother's Milk" shows Patrick dealing with his mother's decline and his own fatherhood. Episode 5 "At Last" brings Patrick toward acceptance and recovery.</p>

<p>The supporting cast provides exceptional performances: Hugo Weaving as David Melrose, Patrick's father, is terrifying—a charismatic, cultured monster who abuses his son while maintaining the facade of aristocratic respectability. Weaving captures David's charm and his cruelty, making him all the more disturbing. Jennifer Jason Leigh as Patrick's mother Eleanor depicts a woman complicit in her husband's abuse through denial and self-absorption, her later dementia providing both tragedy and dark comedy.</p>

<p>Blythe Danner plays older Eleanor in the later episodes, bringing dignity to the character's decline. Allison Williams as Marianne, Patrick's wife, depicts the strain of loving an addict. Jessica Raine as Julia, Prasanna Puwanarajah as Johnny Hall, Pip Torrens as Seamus Dothan, and Holliday Grainger as Bridget—each creates distinct characters in Patrick's world. The child actors Sebastian Maltby and others in the flashback sequences handle the difficult material with sensitivity.</p>

<p>The series' visual style, created by director Edward Berger and cinematographer James Friend, shifts across episodes and time periods. The 1980s episodes feature neon-soaked excess—Patrick's drug-fueled London life depicted with frenetic energy and claustrophobic interiors. The childhood flashbacks at the French estate (actually shot in various French locations) use golden light and pastoral beauty that contrasts with the horror of what occurs there. The later episodes shift toward more naturalistic lighting as Patrick moves toward recovery.</p>

<p>The production design by Suzie Davies and others creates distinct worlds for each time period and location. Patrick's London flat in the 1980s is a mess of drug paraphernalia and aristocratic clutter. The French estate is both beautiful and oppressive. The various houses, hotels, and institutions of later episodes each have distinct character. The costumes by Sheena Napier and others track fashion across the decades while maintaining Patrick's aristocratic style.</p>

<p>The series' engagement with addiction is unflinching and authentic. Episode 1 depicts Patrick's drug use in graphic detail—the preparation, the injection, the high, the crash. The series doesn't glamorize addiction; it shows the desperation, the self-loathing, the physical degradation. Patrick's journey toward recovery is depicted with equal honesty—the difficulty of staying clean, the triggers, the support systems, the possibility of change.</p>

<p>The series' handling of childhood sexual abuse is sensitive and serious. The abuse is not depicted graphically but its effects are shown in devastating detail—Patrick's dissociation, his drug use as self-medication, his difficulty with intimacy, his rage toward his parents. The series suggests that abuse creates lifelong wounds, that recovery is possible but never complete, that speaking truth is part of healing. The material is handled with the seriousness it deserves.</p>

<p>Critical reception was overwhelmingly positive, with particular praise for Cumberbatch's performance and the series' handling of difficult material. It holds 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and received numerous awards including the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor (Cumberbatch) and the BAFTA for Best Mini-Series. Critics noted that the series transcended the "misery memoir" genre through its artistic ambition, dark humor, and ultimately hopeful message.</p>

<p>The series stands as one of the finest literary adaptations in television history—a faithful yet cinematic translation of St Aubyn's novels that captures both their devastating content and their dark wit. Cumberbatch's performance is a career peak, and the series' handling of addiction and trauma is unflinching yet compassionate. Patrick Melrose proves that television can handle the darkest material with artistic ambition, that literary adaptations can achieve their own visual poetry, and that stories of trauma can ultimately be stories of hope.</p>

        <p><strong>Trauma and Addiction:</strong> The series' central theme—the relationship between childhood trauma and adult addiction. Patrick's substance abuse is depicted not as moral failing but as self-medication, an attempt to escape memories of abuse. The series explores how trauma shapes identity, how addiction becomes a way of life, and how recovery requires confronting the past.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Class and Privilege:</strong> The series examines British aristocracy—the privilege that protects abusers, the silence that surrounds upper-class dysfunction, the way wealth insulates the Melrose family from consequences. Patrick's journey includes his rejection of his class and his inheritance, his attempt to create identity separate from his family's toxicity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Recovery and Redemption:</strong> The series ultimately offers hope—Patrick's journey toward recovery, his attempts to be a better father than his own, his gradual acceptance of his past. The series suggests that trauma does not have to define a life, that change is possible, that redemption requires honesty and work.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why 8:</strong> Strong thematic exploration of trauma, class, and recovery. The limitation is occasional didacticism—themes are sometimes stated explicitly through dialogue.</p>

The final scenes suggest that change is possible, that the cycle of abuse can be broken, that speaking truth is itself a form of healing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Arc Completion:</strong> The five-episode structure allows for complete character arc—from rock bottom to recovery, from denial to truth, from isolation to connection. The resolution honors the source material while providing satisfying closure for viewers.</p>

    <div style="color:#888; margin-top:1rem; font-size:0.9rem">
        The final score of 7.47 reflects Patrick Melrose's strong achievement across all seven dimensions. Its combination of Benedict Cumberbatch's extraordinary performance, Edward St Aubyn's literary source material, and unflinching exploration of trauma and addiction—culminating in a hopeful resolution—secures its place as one of the finest limited series of recent years. The show proves that television can handle the darkest material with artistic ambition and sensitivity, that literary adaptations can achieve their own visual poetry, and that stories of trauma can ultimately be stories of hope and redemption.
