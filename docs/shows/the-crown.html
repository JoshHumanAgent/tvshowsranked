<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Queen Elizabeth II's reign, from young princess to elderly monarch. Three actresses (Claire Foy, Olivia Colman, Imelda Staunton) portray her reign. Peter Morgan's history play: the private life of public figures, the crown as burden, duty as cage.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Foy, Colman, and Staunton each define Elizabeth's age. The supporting cast (Matt Smith, Tobias Menzies, Josh O'Connor, Gillian Anderson) creates the royal world. The performances are theatrical and magnificent.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>20th-century Britain: the coronation, the scandals, the crises, Buckingham Palace. The world is complete—the production value is unmatched. History as series.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Netflix's most expensive production: palaces, locations, period detail. The style is prestige—this is history as event.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the monarchy: coronations, weddings, tours, crises. The production provides the grandeur expected. State spectacle as drama.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Duty vs. self, public vs. private, tradition vs. modernity, the crown as institution vs. person. The show explores these through decades of history.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Historical events provide the structure: each season covers years, each episode a crisis. The drive is history—the audience knows what happened, the drama is how.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Six seasons, complete. The show ends with Charles and Diana's story complete, Elizabeth's reign reviewed. The ending is appropriate. Magnificent television.</p></div></section>
