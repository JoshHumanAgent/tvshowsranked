            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Will Travers is an intelligence analyst at a think tank that finds patterns. His wife and daughter died on 9/11. He discovers a pattern in crossword puzzles that leads to a conspiracy with global stakes. James Badge Dale is Will—brilliant, damaged, increasingly paranoid. AMC's slow-burn conspiracy thriller, cancelled too soon, remains one of television's most intelligent explorations of the intelligence world.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>James Badge Dale anchors the show: the analyst who can't stop seeing patterns, the widower who can't stop grieving. The supporting cast (Miranda Richardson, Arliss Howard, Dallas Roberts) creates a world of bureaucrats, spies, and analysts. The performances are understated—this is the intelligence world, not action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Intelligence analysis: the think tanks, the government contracts, the people who read reports for a living. The world is accurate—this is how intelligence analysis actually works, not the spy fantasy. The bureaucracy is the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Intentionally drab: offices, conference rooms, brownstones. The style is bureaucratic realism—the conspiracy hides in plain sight, in memos and reports. The look serves the paranoia without calling attention to itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people reading documents, talking in offices, noticing patterns. The "spectacle" is intellectual—the thrill of deduction, the terror of what the deduction reveals. The driest thriller ever made.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Intelligence analysis vs. intelligence action, whether seeing patterns means they exist, the banality of conspiracy, the intelligence-industrial complex. The show explores how organizations make decisions based on analysis that might be wrong. Profound and patient.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Slow. Deliberate. The conspiracy unfolds through documents, meetings, small discoveries. The pace is the point—intelligence work is slow, and then suddenly it isn't. Patient viewers rewarded; others found it boring. The cancellation reflected the audience divide.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after one season. The conspiracy is revealed but not resolved. The show was building toward something larger; we got the first act. A cult classic because of what it promised, not what it delivered.</p>
