            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                London's criminal underground as family business. The Harrigans run their empire from restaurants and estates, old money meeting new violence. Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren as the patriarch and matriarch bring Shakespearean weight to gangster conventions. Tom Hardy is the fixer caught between empires. It's succession meets The Sopranos, British-style: tea at four, bodies by five.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The casting coup: Pierce Brosnan as the aging crime lord, Helen Mirren as his steel-spined wife, Tom Hardy as the violence-dispensing problem solver. The intergenerational conflict—sons who aren't built for the business, outsiders threatening territory—is familiar but delivered with conviction. Hardy in particular excels at physical presence and barely-contained rage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>London's gangland rendered with specificity: the restaurants, the estates, the territorial boundaries, the alliances and blood feuds. The show understands British class dynamics—crime as a route upward in a rigid society. The world is contained but detailed, a criminal ecosystem with rules and hierarchies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Standard prestige TV polish. London looks good—the city as character, fog and rain and Georgian architecture. The violence is shot clearly, not artfully. This isn't pushing visual boundaries, but it serves the story. Functional, not memorable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Periodic violence punctuates the family drama. The spectacle is in the performances—Brosnan's quiet menace, Mirren's calculated warmth, Hardy's explosive brutality. Budget shows on screen in locations and production value, but the spectacle is character-driven rather than set-piece driven.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Familiar crime family dynamics: the aging don, the succession crisis, the loyal soldier, the rival gangs. MobLand doesn't revolutionize the genre—it executes established conventions with top-tier talent. Thematic depth is present but not developed: legacy, loyalty, the cost of power.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic crime drama with serialized tension. Each episode advances multiple threads: family politics, external threats, personal betrayals. The pacing is deliberate but effective—you want to see what happens next. The show knows when to accelerate and when to simmer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Too early to judge resolution. The first season establishes the players and conflicts effectively. Whether the show can deliver a satisfying conclusion depends on planning not yet visible. Potential is there; execution remains to be seen.</p>
