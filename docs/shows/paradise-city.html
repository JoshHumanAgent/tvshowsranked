<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A young rock band on tour discovers the music industry is darker than they imagined. Paradise City is the spiritual sequel to American Satan: occult rock music, industry exploitation, and genuine supernatural horror. Andy Biersack plays Johnny Faust, a singer navigating fame and temptation. The show has real rock stars—Andy Black, Asking Alexandria, Black Veil Brides—playing fictionalized versions. The occult elements are treated seriously: making deals, blood sacrifices, and cosmic horror. The production values exceed the genre—Amazon gave this indie rock production budget. The supernatural horror serves the music industry satire: selling your soul is literal. For fans of metal, horror, and the dark side of fame.</p>
