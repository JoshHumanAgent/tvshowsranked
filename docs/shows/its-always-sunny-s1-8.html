<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">The Gang runs a bar in Philadelphia. They're terrible people—narcissists, sociopaths, and idiots. Seasons 1-8 are peak Sunny: "The Nightman Cometh," "The D.E.N.N.I.S. System," "The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis." Comedy as cruelty perfected.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Charlie, Dennis, Mac, Dee, Frank: comedy's worst people, performed with genius. Danny DeVito joins in S2. The ensemble created the cringe comedy template.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (6/10)</h3><p>Paddy's Pub: the bar, Philadelphia, the Gang's schemes. The world is their selfishness.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>FX low budget: the bar, the city, talking heads. Visual simplicity serves the comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is people being awful in a bar. The spectacle is audacity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Narcissism, idiocy, the comedy of awfulness. The show explores terrible people without redemption.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Each episode: the scheme, the failure, the status quo. The drive is watching awful people fail.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>S1-8 represent peak Sunny. The show continued but these are the classic seasons. Status quo comedy perfected.</p></div></section>
