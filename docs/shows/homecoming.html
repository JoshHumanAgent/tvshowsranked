<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Heidi Bergman runs a facility helping soldiers transition back to civilian life. Years later, she's working at a diner, contacted by a Department of Defense auditor asking why she left. Homecoming is paranoid thriller as podcast adaptation—short episodes, claustrophobic frames, sound design as weapon. Julia Roberts produces and stars, bringing movie-star gravity to TV. The mystery unfolds across dual timelines: before and after, facility and diner. Sam Esmail directs the first season with Mr. Robot visual precision. You watch because you need to know what they did, and what Heidi forgot.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Julia Roberts commits fully—Heidi is present in every frame, hiding secrets even from herself. Bobby Cannavale as her boss plays corporate menace with plausible deniability. Shea Whigham's investigator is dogged humanity. The soldiers feel real; everyone's compromised but trying. Performances anchor the strangeness.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>The Homecoming facility: bright, helpful, sinister beneath. The Geist Corporation: private military contractor with plausible deniability. The diner: nothingness that becomes everything. The world feels like our present pushed five degrees sideways.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>Sam Esmail's direction is unmistakable: odd angles, negative space, faces in profile, rooms that feel wrong. The two timelines have distinct color temperatures. Sound design matters—headphones recommended. The visual language creates paranoia without stating it.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is rooms and faces and phone calls. The thriller is psychological—what was done, why it was hidden, who knows. The production design is institutional minimalism: cubicles, cafeterias, empty streets.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Memory manipulation, corporate accountability, the militarization of mental health, complicity in systems. The show asks what we choose to forget and whether forgetting is protection or crime. Geist is every contractor; Heidi is everyone who looked away.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Half-hour episodes, total commitment. Each reveals one more piece: the timeline, the subject, the project's purpose, Heidi's complicity. The questions drive: What is Homecoming? Why can't Heidi remember? What happened to the soldier? Binge structure by design.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Season 1 is a complete story with clear resolution: Heidi knows, the truth emerges, Geist doesn't win. Season 2 continues with different characters (Janelle Monáe) in the same world. Both seasons work independently. The ending respects closure.</p></div></section>
