<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A boy is murdered in a small coastal town. Everyone is a suspect. David Tennant is the damaged detective; Olivia Colman is the local who knows everyone. Chris Chibnall's mystery: the community tearing apart, the secrets revealed, the coast as Greek chorus.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>David Tennant as Alec Hardy: the outsider with secrets. Olivia Colman as Ellie Miller: the local whose life is destroyed. Jodie Whittaker, Andrew Buchan, Arthur Darvill—the town is fully cast. The performances are British drama at its best.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Broadchurch, Dorset: the cliffs, the beach, the community. The world is small-town Britain—everyone knows everyone, everyone has secrets. The location is character.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>ITV production: the Dorset coast photographed with gothic beauty, the cliffs as omen. The style is observational—watching a community fall apart.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is murder investigation: interviews, secrets, the town unraveling. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching a community confront what it's hiding.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Grief, community, whether we can ever know anyone, the cost of secrets, how murder destroys more than the victim. The show explores these with depth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (10/10)</h3><p>Who killed the boy? Each episode reveals more secrets, narrows suspects, deepens the tragedy. The structure is mystery—impossible to stop watching.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Three seasons. Season 1 is the boy's murder—perfect. Season 2 is the trial—divisive but complete. Season 3 is a new case—strong. The first season is the classic.</p></div></section>
