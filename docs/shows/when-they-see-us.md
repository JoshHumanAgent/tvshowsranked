## What It Feels Like to Watch

In 1989, a woman was brutally attacked in Central Park. Within hours, police had rounded up five Black and Latino teenagers from Harlem, coerced false confessions from them, and charged them with crimes they didn't commit. When They See Us tells their story.

Ava DuVernay directs this limited series with a fury that never lets up. The four episodes follow the five men—Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise—from the night of the attack through their arrests, their trials, their prison sentences, and finally their exoneration years later when the real attacker confessed. The series jumps back and forth in time, showing how the trauma reverberated across decades.

The performances are extraordinary. Jharrel Jerome, as the youngest of the five, carries the final episode as Korey Wise, whose story is the most devastating. The actors playing the boys capture the confusion, fear, and gradual understanding that something has gone terribly wrong. The adults—John Leguizamo as Korey's father, Vera Farmiga and Felicity Huffman as the prosecutors—are cast without sympathy, which is exactly the point.

This is difficult viewing. The police coercion, the media circus, the injustice of it all—it builds into an unbearable weight. But the series is not exploitative. It's a reckoning. It shows how the criminal justice system failed these boys, how the city painted them as guilty before the trial began, how their lives were stolen from them. And it shows the quiet dignity with which they eventually rebuilt themselves.

The final episode, which shows the real men alongside the actors, is heartbreaking. You see the years on their faces. You see what was taken from them. And you understand that the story isn't really over—because the same systems that failed them then are still failing people today.

This is television as testimony. It doesn't ask you to feel good. It asks you to bear witness.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 1.90**

**Strengths:**
- **Korey Wise (Jharrel Jerome)**: An Emmy-worthy performance that carries the final episode. Jerome captures the devastation of a boy lost to the system.
- **The Exonerated Five**: Each actor (Caleeb, Joshua, Ethan, Freddy, John) brings authenticity and dignity to these real men.
- **The boys**: Child actors capture the confusion and fear of teenagers facing adult consequences.
- **Linda McCray (Aunjanue Ellis)**: The mother who never stopped believing is a pillar of strength.
- **Korey's father (John Leguizamo)**: Powerful as the parent who trusted the system and was betrayed.
- **The prosecutors**: Vera Farmiga and Felicity Huffman are deliberately unsympathetic—exactly what's needed.

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited development for some supporting characters.
- The prosecutors feel somewhat one-dimensional (intentionally).

**Why 9.5 and not 10.0**: Exceptional ensemble work, but the four-episode limit prevents full character depth.

## Why It Ranks #29

When They See Us is essential television—an unflinching examination of one of America's greatest injustices. Ava DuVernay directs with fury and compassion, giving voice to five men whose lives were stolen by a racist system. The performances are extraordinary, particularly Jharrel Jerome as Korey Wise.

The limitations are structural—the four-episode limit prevents full exploration of the decades after exoneration, and the narrative resolution, while satisfying for the case itself, can't address the ongoing systemic issues. But within its scope, When They See Us achieves something vital: it forces viewers to confront how the criminal justice system fails Black and Latino men.

This is television as testimony, as reckoning, as history. It doesn't provide comfort—it provides truth. And sometimes that's exactly what television should do.
