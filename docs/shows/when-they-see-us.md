## What It Feels Like to Watch

In 1989, a woman was brutally attacked in Central Park. Within hours, police had rounded up five Black and Latino teenagers from Harlem, coerced false confessions from them, and charged them with crimes they didn't commit. *When They See Us* tells their story.

Ava DuVernay directs this limited series with a fury that never lets up. The four episodes follow the five men — Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise — from the night of the attack through their arrests, their trials, their prison sentences, and finally their exoneration years later when the real attacker confessed. The series jumps back and forth in time, showing how the trauma reverberated across decades.

The performances are extraordinary. Jharrel Jerome, as the youngest of the five, carries the final episode as Korey Wise, whose story is the most devastating. The actors playing the boys capture the confusion, fear, and gradual understanding that something has gone terribly wrong. The adults — John Leguizamo as Korey's father, Vera Farmiga and Felicity Huffman as the prosecutors — are cast without sympathy, which is exactly the point.

This is difficult viewing. The police coercion, the media circus, the injustice of it all — it builds into an unbearable weight. But the series is not exploitative. It's a reckoning. It shows how the criminal justice system failed these boys, how the city painted them as guilty before the trial began, how their lives were stolen from them. And it shows the quiet dignity with which they eventually rebuilt themselves.

The final episode, which shows the real men alongside the actors, is heartbreaking. You see the years on their faces. You see what was taken from them. And you understand that the story isn't really over — because the same systems that failed them then are still failing people today.

This is television as testimony. It doesn't ask you to feel good. It asks you to bear witness.
