<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Park Sae-ro-yi spends seven years in prison for assaulting the man who killed his father. He emerges with a single goal: open a bar in Itaewon and destroy the chaebol empire that destroyed his family. Itaewon Class is class warfare as David-and-Goliath revenge: a nobody with principle against a corporate dynasty with no limits. Park Seo-joon plays Sae-ro-yi as stubborn righteousness—the man won't bend, won't cheat, won't abandon his code. Kim Da-mi's Jo Yi-seo is genius-level antisocial, and she falls for him completely. The show spans years, building bar to franchise to empire while the villain grows more desperate. You'll root for principle over power.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Park Seo-joon's Sae-ro-yi is infuriatingly principled—he won't cut corners, won't use connections, won't compromise. This makes him noble and sometimes stupid. Kim Da-mi's Jo Yi-seo steals every scene as a sociopathic mastermind who discovers love. The villain Jang Dae-hee is chilling—a man who believes ruthlessness is virtue. Every character is ideology made flesh.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7.5/10)</h3><p>Itaewon as microcosm—international, gentrifying, full of misfits finding community. The bar industry, the franchise business, the chaebol world all feel distinct and researched. The seven-year timespan lets characters age believably. Social class is visible in every interaction.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Bright, modern K-drama aesthetic. The bar sequences glow with warmth. The chaebol offices gleam cold. The time-jumps are handled smoothly. Nothing revolutionary, but the visuals serve character and emotion.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. The drama is human-scale: business negotiations, restaurant openings, emotional confrontations. The "war" is corporate. The show trusts character over production design.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7.5/10)</h3><p>Principle versus pragmatism. Class mobility in Korea. Whether revenge can justify any means. The show asks whether success requires corruption—and whether Sae-ro-yi's stubbornness is virtue or vanity. The themes are right on the surface.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>The multi-year structure creates genuine stakes. We watch Sae-ro-yi grow from ex-con dishwasher to franchise owner. The villain escalates in parallel. Each episode advances business and personal plots. The finale confrontation is earned.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Complete series with definitive ending. Romance resolves, business triumphs, revenge pays out. Some find the villain's fate too merciful; others find it earned. The show prioritizes principle over satisfaction. It ends as it begins: Sae-ro-yi staying true.</p></div></section>
