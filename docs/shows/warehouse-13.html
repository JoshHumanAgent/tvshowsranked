            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Secret Service agents Pete and Myka are assigned to Warehouse 13, a massive facility in South Dakota that stores supernatural artifacts. Lewis Carroll's mirror, Edgar Allan Poe's pen, H.G. Wells' time machine—objects with powers must be collected and contained. X-Files meets Friday Night Lights: monster-of-the-week with humor and heart.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Eddie McClintock as Pete is the comic heart: goofy, instinctive, loyal. Joanne Kelly as Myka provides the by-the-book professionalism. Saul Rubinek as Artie is the warehouse's caretaker. The ensemble creates found-family dynamics. The performances are light and committed to the premise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Warehouse 13 itself is the world: endless shelves of artifacts, each with a history and power. The mythology expands across seasons—the warehouse's origins, previous agents, the Regents who oversee. The world is consistent and imaginative.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Syfy production: the warehouse looks vast, the artifacts do their thing, the effects are TV-budget but sufficient. The style is functional adventure television—colorful, kinetic, fun.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The artifacts provide spectacle: mirror universes, time travel, ghosts, possession. Each episode has a magical set piece. The effects are imaginative within budget constraints.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Collecting dangerous objects, the responsibility of power, found family. The themes are light—the show prioritizes adventure and humor. This is comfort fantasy, not philosophical exploration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic artifact retrieval with serialized arcs: the warehouse's enemies, H.G. Wells' story, the characters' relationships. The structure is classic adventure—problem, retrieval, resolution, character development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with conclusion. The warehouse's fate is resolved; the characters' stories conclude. The finale provides appropriate closure for a show that always valued character over stakes.</p>
