            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Ragnar Lothbrok is a farmer who becomes a legendary Viking raider. He sails west to England, builds an empire, and creates a dynasty that will reshape history. Travis Fimmel is Ragnar—charismatic, ambitious, ultimately tragic. Michael Hirst created History Channel's first scripted drama: Viking legend as family saga, with blood, betrayal, and gods.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Travis Fimmel's Ragnar is the center for the first four seasons: the farmer who becomes king, the king who loses everything. Katheryn Winnick as Lagertha provides the warrior queen energy. Clive Standen, Gustaf Skarsgård, Alexander Ludwig—the sons and rivals create a dynastic saga. The performances embrace the epic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Viking Age Scandinavia: Kattegat, the ships, the raids, the gods. England as target and destination. The world expands across seasons—the Mediterranean, Iceland, the Rus. The historical detail is researched while embracing legend.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>History Channel drama: the ships are majestic, the battles are staged with scale, the landscapes are beautiful. The style is epic television—Game of Thrones without dragons. The battles are visceral and clear.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Naval battles, raids, duels, sieges. The spectacle is historical warfare: shield walls, longboats, brutal combat. The budget is visible on screen. This is action television with historical weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ambition, legacy, the gods' will, whether power corrupts or reveals, family vs. empire. The show explores these through Ragnar and his sons. The themes are epic but accessible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Ragnar's rise, then his sons' expansion. Each season has raids, betrayals, wars. The drive is dynastic—who will inherit, who will survive. The pacing is propulsive; the body count is high.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Six seasons with conclusion. Ragnar's story ends in season 4; his sons continue. The finale provides closure for the saga. The show outlived its protagonist but maintained quality.</p>
