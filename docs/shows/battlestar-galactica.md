## The Landscape

The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. They rebelled. And now they've destroyed the Twelve Colonies. 50,000 survivors flee across space in a fleet protected by one aging Battlestar. Ronald D. Moore's reimagining elevated sci-fi into serious drama.

## The Characters

Admiral Adama: the father leading his people home. President Roslin: the dying leader prophesied by scripture. Starbuck: the pilot who breaks all the rules. Apollo: the son trying to escape his father's shadow. Baltar: the traitor who might save humanity. And the Cylons: machines indistinguishable from gods.

## What It Feels Like

Like 9/11 commentary dressed as space opera. Like a show that asks what makes us human when our enemies look exactly like us. Like proof that science fiction can be the most serious art form.

## All of This Has Happened Before

The cyclical history, the hybrid child, the final five. Battlestar built mystery into its mythology—and largely paid it off in ways that mattered.
