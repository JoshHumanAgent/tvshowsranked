            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Washington at night. A man looking directly at you, telling you what he's about to do, and daring you to stop him. The marble halls of power smell like desperation. Every smile conceals a knife. Kevin Spacey's Southern accent is a put-on—the character's entire persona is a put-on—and you're in on the con. It's Shakespeare for the HBO era: Richard III in a Senate office building, wheeling and dealing his way to the throne.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Frank Underwood is among television's greatest villains—charismatic, terrifying, meticulously crafted. Claire Underwood, played by Robin Wright, might be better: ice water in veins, every bit as ruthless, more disciplined. Their marriage is a partnership of predators, the most compelling political union on television. The supporting players—Kate Mara's Zoe Barnes, Corey Stoll's Peter Russo, Michael Kelly's Doug Stamper—are Shakespearean in their fallibility. The acting is across-the-board superb.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Washington rendered as labyrinth: the Hill, the White House, the press, the money. The show maps American power with journalistic accuracy—who has it, how it moves, what it costs. The institutions are characters, their rules both cage and weapon. This is the best political world-building since The West Wing, though The West Wing was about idealism while this is about teeth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>David Fincher directed the first two episodes and established the visual grammar: cool blues, sharp shadows, frames within frames. The fourth-wall breaks—Frank talking to camera—are handled with elegant integration. Washington looks like what it is: beautiful architecture housing ugly business. The style serves the cynicism.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is rhetorical—Frank's monologues, Claire's silences. This is people in rooms talking, but the talking is weaponized. No car chases, no explosions. The spectacle is psychological violence rendered visible through performance and editing. When physical violence occurs (and it does), it's shocking precisely because the show usually operates through words.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Power as drug. Ambition as pathology. Marriage as transaction. The show dramatizes Machiavelli for the streaming age, exploring how democracies produce autocrats. Frank isn't an aberration—he's what the system selects for. The conceptual framework is clear: American politics is a game, and the players are playing for keeps.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode ends with Frank one step closer or one scheme exposed—the tension never releases. The plotting is intricate but clear: you always know what Frank wants, what stands in his way, and what he's willing to do. The narrative machinery hums. This is television designed to be binged, and it delivers on that promise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Seasons 1-2 are complete: Frank becomes President. The journey is satisfying, the destination earned. The problem is what comes after—seasons 3-6 lose their way, repeating variations on the same themes without advancing. The show peaked early, then declined. That decline doesn't retroactively damage seasons 1-2, but it tempers enthusiasm for the whole. The eventual Kevin Spacey scandal adds unfortunate resonance to the fiction.</p>
