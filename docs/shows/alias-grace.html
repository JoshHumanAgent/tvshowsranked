<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Grace Marks was convicted of murder in 1840s Canada. Did she do it? A doctor interviews her to find out. Margaret Atwood's novel adapted by Sarah Polley: memory as fiction, truth as mystery, the servant girl who may be innocent or may be playing everyone.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Sarah Gadon as Grace: the unreliable narrator, the possible murderer. Edward Holcroft as Dr. Jordan: the man trying to understand. The performances capture the ambiguity—Grace may be innocent, may be cunning, may be both.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>1840s Canada: the prison, the household, the class system. The world is specific—the servant's position, the master's power, the woman's lack of options.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>Netflix/CBC production: period detail, the domestic horror, the interviews. The style serves the ambiguity—nothing is certain.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is memory and interview: Grace tells her story, we decide if we believe her. The "spectacle" is psychological.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Memory, truth, class and gender, what we tell ourselves vs. what happened, the stories women tell to survive. Atwood's themes adapted faithfully.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Did Grace kill her employers? Each interview reveals more, each memory is questioned. The structure is mystery—the truth is elusive.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The truth remains ambiguous—the ending is appropriate to the material. Did she or didn't she? The show doesn't answer. Masterful.</p></div></section>
