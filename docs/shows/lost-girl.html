            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Bo is a succubus who grew up human. She discovers she's Fae—one of a hidden race that feeds on humans. She refuses to choose a side in the Fae war between Light and Dark. Anna Silk is Bo: sexual, powerful, trying to do good while feeding on life energy. Michelle Lovretta created urban fantasy with sex-positive bisexual protagonist.

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Anna Silk as Bo is charismatic and grounded. Zoie Palmer as Lauren (the human doctor), Ksenia Solo as Kenzi (the human best friend), Kris Holden-Ried as Dyson (the shifter). The ensemble creates a found family. The performances are committed to the fantasy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Canadian TV production: urban settings, fantasy creatures rendered with budget, the Fae clubs and rituals. The style is functional—the world carries what budget can't show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Fae powers: succubus feeding, shifter transformation, elemental abilities. The spectacle is TV-budget fantasy—practical effects where possible, CG where necessary. The sexuality is more notable than the effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>

            </div>
