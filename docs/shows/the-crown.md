## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Crown traces the life of Queen Elizabeth II from her ascension to the throne in 1952 to the present day. It's a story of duty, family, and the burden of monarchy—told with Hollywood-level production values and performances.

Each season covers roughly a decade, with the cast changing to reflect the ages of the characters. The production is breathtaking—the costumes, the sets, the locations. You feel transported to Buckingham Palace, to the Scottish Highlands, to the world of 1950s Britain.

But it's not just pretty. The writing examines the tensions between duty and desire, public and private. Claire Foy and Olivia Colman as Elizabeth capture the weight of the crown—the way it constrains even as it elevates.

The supporting cast is remarkable. Matt Smith as Prince Philip provides the restless energy. John Lithgow as Winston Churchill is a revelation. The series makes you understand these figures as humans, not monuments.
