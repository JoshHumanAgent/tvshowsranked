## The Landscape

Elizabeth II's reign from 1947 to the 2000s, told through the lens of private moments and public crises. Peter Morgan elevates biography to Shakespearean scope—royalty as tragedy, history as intimacy, power as isolation.

## The Characters

Elizabeth: duty as weight. Philip: the consort's resentment. Margaret: the shadow queen. Diana: the people's princess trapped by protocol. Charles: Prince of Wales, forever waiting. The crown passes through women; the weight stays the same.

## What It Feels Like

Like watching the 20th century unfold through palace windows. Like understanding that the personal is always political, especially when you're royal. The most expensive television ever made, and every dollar visible in the craftsmanship.

## The Acting Recasting

Claire Foy to Olivia Colman to Imelda Staunton—different women, same crown, same burden. It's not continuity; it's commentary on how time wears even the most powerful.
