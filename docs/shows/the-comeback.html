            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Valerie Cherish is a sitcom star from the 90s making a comeback. A reality show documents her return to television, playing the aunt on a new sitcom. Lisa Kudrow is Valerie—desperate, vain, humiliated, and somehow sympathetic. Michael Patrick King's show was cancelled after one season, revived nine years later. Television's cringiest comedy became television's most devastating portrait of celebrity desperation.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Lisa Kudrow creates one of television's great characters: Valerie's smile that isn't a smile, her "I'm fine" that means she isn't, her desperate need to be loved. The supporting cast (Malin Åkerman, Laura Silverman, Damian Young) are perfect foils. Kudrow's performance is fearless—she humiliates Valerie without losing our sympathy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Hollywood reality television: the cameras that follow Valerie, the producers who manipulate, the sets where everything goes wrong. The world is accurate—nepotism, desperation, the industry that eats its own. The mockumentary format allows us to see what Valerie doesn't.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Reality TV aesthetic: handheld cameras, talking heads, captured moments. The style serves the satire—we're watching what the reality show wants us to see, and then we see more. Functional and intentional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people in rooms, humiliating each other. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching Valerie degrade herself for camera time. The show is anti-spectacle by design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p> Celebrity, dignity, age, gender, what we sacrifice for fame, whether being seen is worth being seen badly. The show explores the entertainment industry's cruelty to women over 40. Valerie is pathetic and sympathetic simultaneously—a difficult, brilliant balance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic humiliation with serialized desperation: Valerie wants to be a star, the reality show documents her failure, the sitcom humiliates her further. The drive is watching Valerie survive. The 2014 season elevates the stakes—awards season, industry validation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, nine years apart. The first season ends on a note of survival; the second provides darker resolution. The comeback doesn't come back—Valerie gets validation, but at what cost? The ending is appropriate to the character.</p>
