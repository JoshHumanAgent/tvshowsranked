            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Eun-gyeol is a CODA—child of deaf adults—who can hear but lives in both worlds. He finds a mysterious music shop, travels back in time to 1995, and meets his parents as teenagers. He must ensure they fall in love or he won't exist. Ryeoun and Choi Hyun-wook star in the K-drama time-travel romance: family, music, and changing the past.

                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama production: 1995 rendered with period detail, the two timelines visually distinguished, music as emotional throughline. The style is warm and nostalgic.</p>

                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is emotional: the time travel, the music, the connections across generations. This is romance and family drama—not action, but feeling. The music is the real spectacle.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
