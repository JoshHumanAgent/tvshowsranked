            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                David Budd is a war veteran with PTSD, now protecting the Home Secretary whose policies he despises. Richard Madden is the bodyguard; Keeley Hawes is the politician. An assassination attempt, a conspiracy, a train hijacking—six episodes of breathless tension. Jed Mercurio creates thriller as endurance test: every episode ends on a cliffhanger, every assumption is challenged, no one is safe.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Richard Madden's performance is physical and internal—we see his trauma in his eyes, his decisions, his breakdowns. Keeley Hawes as the Home Secretary is steely, complicated, human. The supporting cast includes Gina McKee (also in The Tunnel) as Budd's superior. The performances are uniformly strong; Madden and Hawes are exceptional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>British politics and security services: the Home Office, police protection squads, the machinery of government. The show captures the tension between personal belief and professional duty. The world is specific and credible—the security protocols, the political pressures, the media environment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC thriller production: tight close-ups, claustrophobic framing, the train carriage as pressure cooker. The opening sequence on the train is among TV's most tense. The style serves the content—this is anxiety as filmmaking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is tension, not effects: the train sequence, the assassination attempt, the final confrontation. The action is staged with credibility. The production doesn't overwhelm the performances. Spectacle of suspense.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>PTSD, political compromise, the cost of security state policies. Budd's trauma is central—he can't escape what he experienced in Afghanistan. The show explores the impossible positions created by modern politics: protecting someone whose policies created your trauma. Themes present but secondary to thrills.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Six episodes, relentless momentum. Each episode ends with a bombshell; each revelation forces reconsideration. The structure is pure thriller—propulsive, paranoid, exhausting in the best way. Among television's most binge-worthy shows. The drive doesn't stop.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The conspiracy is revealed, the resolution achieved, the cost tallied. The ending is satisfying but leaves room for continuation (a second season has been discussed). As a standalone, it works. As a pilot for more, it also works.</p>
