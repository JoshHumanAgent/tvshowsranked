            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                San Francisco. Patrick is looking for love, Agustín is looking for purpose, Dom is looking for direction. They're gay men in their thirties, navigating careers, relationships, and friendship. Michael Lannan and Andrew Haigh created television that captured a specific moment and community: post-marriage-equality, pre-fully-accepted, modern gay life in a city that's changing. Quiet, observational, intimate.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jonathan Groff as Patrick is the centre: neurotic, hopeful, making mistakes. Frankie J. Alvarez as Agustín and Murray Bartlett as Dom complete the trio. The supporting cast (Raúl Castillo, Russell Tovey, Lauren Weedman) creates a community. The performances are naturalistic—this feels like life, not television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>San Francisco: the Castro, the bars, the apartments, the restaurants. The world is specific to place and community—gentrifying neighborhoods, aging friends, the tech boom's impact on gay life. The world is rendered with documentary care.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Andrew Haigh's direction is observational: static cameras, natural light, scenes allowed to breathe. The style is European—influenced, intimate without being intrusive. The sex scenes are frank without being gratuitous. The visual language matches the emotional tone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people in apartments, bars, parks. The "spectacle" is intimacy—watching relationships develop, seeing bodies in space. The show is anti-spectacle by design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Gay life in transition, intimacy and its fears, friendship as family, the city that's changing. The show captures a specific moment: marriage is legal, apps are replacing bars, community is both stronger and more fragmented. The themes are present in the situations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The drive is character: will Patrick find love, will Dom open his restaurant, will Agustín figure himself out. The pacing is deliberate—this is life drama, not event drama. Some found it slow; others found it realistic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons plus a movie. The movie provides the closure the series was denied—Patrick's story reaches an endpoint. The cancellation was premature; the movie is a gift. The conclusion satisfies.</p>
