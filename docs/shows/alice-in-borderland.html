<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Arisu and his friends find Tokyo empty—everyone vanished. Then they're forced to play deadly games to survive. Alice in Borderland is Japanese survival horror meets Lewis Carroll: solve puzzles or die, collect face cards or stay trapped. The games range from physical to intellectual to psychological, each more brutal than the last. Arisu discovers hidden depths; Kuina reveals her past; Chishiya plays everyone. This is what happens when Squid Game meets Alice's Wonderland—intellectual, brutal, and genuinely surprising.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3><p>Kento Yamazaki's Arisu transforms from directionless gamer to someone who values existence. The supporting cast reveals depths: Kuina's transgender identity and fighting skill, Chishiya's sociopathic brilliance, Usagi's survival grief. The performances ground absurd situations.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>The Borderland rules emerge systematically: card suits indicate game type (hearts = psychological, spades = physical, diamonds = intellectual, clubs = teamwork). Face cards mean harder games. The empty Tokyo is eerie infrastructure for survival mechanics. The backstory reveals why and how.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Empty Tokyo sequences are haunting—the city without its people. Game set pieces have tension and clarity. The visual language shifts with game type: hearts feel intimate, spades feel kinetic. Netflix budget visible in scope.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The games provide spectacle: burning buildings, collapsing floors, armed hunters. Each game has unique design—tennis court death match, maze of tag, botanical garden executions. The spectacle is in the creativity of death.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Games as life metaphor. What people reveal under pressure. Whether survival justifies betrayal. The show explores cooperation versus competition, the value of life without purpose, and whether games reveal truth. The cards add Lewis Carroll resonance.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8.5/10)</h3><p>Relentless. Each game escalates stakes. The mystery of the Borderland's origin drives until revealed. Character backstories provide human stakes amid survival. You watch to see what game comes next and who survives it.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Season 1 provides partial answers; Season 2 completes the face cards and reveals the Borderland's truth. The ending (in the source manga and show) reframes everything about life, death, and survival. Satisfying, though debated. The show adapts the complete manga.</p></div></section>
