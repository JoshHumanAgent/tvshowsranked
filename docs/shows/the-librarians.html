            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The Library contains the world's magical artifacts. The Librarian protects them. Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle) was the solo Librarian; now a team joins him—the art historian, the thief, the mathematician, the cowboy. They travel the world, retrieving artifacts before villains can use them. Warehouse 13 meets Indiana Jones with a sense of humor about itself.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Noah Wyle as Flynn provides the bridge from the TV movies. Rebecca Romijn, Christian Kane, Lindy Booth, and John Harlan Kim are the team. John Larroquette provides gravitas as Jenkins. The performances embrace the show's light tone—they know this is fun, not prestige.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Library, the Door to Anywhere, the artifacts scattered across the world, the ancient orders (good and evil). The mythology is consistent and expansive—the show respects its own rules while having fun. Each artifact is a story; each mission is an adventure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>TNT production: the world locations look accessible, the magical effects are TV-budget but creative. The style is adventure-light—colorful, kinetic, fun. The effects serve the story without impressing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is magic: spells, artifacts, mythical creatures. Each episode features a magical set piece. The effects are sufficient for television adventure. Fun without being impressive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Knowledge as power, the responsibility of guardianship, teamwork over individual genius. The themes are present but light—this is adventure television, not philosophical exploration. The show knows what it is.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic artifact retrieval with serialized villain arcs. Each episode has a mission; each season has a larger threat. The structure is classic adventure—problem, journey, solution, character development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with conclusion. The final season resolves the Library's fate and the team's development. The show ended appropriately; the movies established the world, the series expanded it, the finale completed it.</p>
