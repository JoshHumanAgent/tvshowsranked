## What It Feels Like to Watch

Gomorrah offers the most brutally realistic portrayal of organized crime since The Wire, set in the Naples housing projects where the Camorra operates. Based on Roberto Saviano's investigative reporting, the show refuses to romanticize the mafia—the violence is graphic, the betrayals are constant, and survival is never guaranteed.

You watch because the characters feel authentically trapped in their circumstances, born into a system where escape is nearly impossible. The show follows multiple factions within the Camorra, showing how power flows and shifts through blood and treachery.

Across 58 episodes, the series maintains a relentless pace and unflinching gaze. There are no heroes here—only people navigating impossible choices, and the consequences are always permanent.
