<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Skrulls have infiltrated Earth at the highest levels—no one is who they seem. Nick Fury returns from space to stop a Skrull terrorist plot that threatens global nuclear war. Samuel L. Jackson gets the spotlight he deserves, playing Fury as a tired old spymaster facing his past choices. Secret Invasion was marketed as MCU's Andor—paranoid spy thriller, serious tone, moral complexity. The show tries: paranoia, moral ambiguity, Cold War atmosphere. But the execution stumbles over Marvel's need for spectacle, the CGI is sometimes unforgivable, and the plot simplifies into standard superhero resolution. Ben Mendelsohn's Talos and Kingsley Ben-Adir's Gravik are excellent. Emilia Clarke's G'iah gets character development that almost justifies the show's existence. The show wants to ask hard questions about refuge, assimilation, and security; Marvel's machinery doesn't let it.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3><p>Samuel L. Jackson brings gravitas—aging Fury, failed promises, world-weariness. Ben Mendelsohn's Talos is the emotional center—refugee leader, father, diplomat. Kingsley Ben-Adir makes Gravik's radicalization tragic, not villainous. Emilia Clarke's G'iah evolves from terrorist to hero. The acting is stronger than the material.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (6/10)</h3><p>Skrull refugees, government infiltration, global threat scale. The show establishes stakes but can't sustain the paranoia—Super-Skrulls in the finale betray the grounded setup. The politics are referenced but unexplored. The MCU's biggest stakes feel small.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>Attempts noir atmosphere—shadows, reflections, surveillance. But green screen environments fail; the show looks cheap. The finale's CGI is notoriously bad. Practical locations work; digital ones don't. Television competence, not cinematic ambition.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The Skrull transformations are effective early. The Super-Skrull fights in the finale look unfinished. Budget constraints visible in every digital environment. The show needed either Andor-level production or smaller scale; it got neither.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Refugee crisis, assimilation, radicalization, security state's cost. The show asks whether Fury's promises were lies or impossible ideals. It doesn't answer—Marvel needs Fury for future movies. The political questions are raised and abandoned for action.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3><p>The mystery (who's a Skrull?) collapses too early. The escalation feels rushed. Episode 4's twist almost justifies the show. The finale's resolution undermines everything before it. Six episodes wasn't enough space to earn the paranoia or the reveals.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5.5/10)</h3><p>Complete limited series with MCU implications. The show ends with G'iah's transformation and the status quo of the Skrull crisis. Fury returns to space, leaving Earth compromised. The resolution exists to set up future movies more than close satisfying arcs.</p></div></section>
