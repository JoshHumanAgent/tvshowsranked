            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Angela Chase is 15. She's changing—dying her hair red, distancing from her parents, falling for Jordan Catalano. Her best friend Rayanne is chaotic, her other friend Rickie is searching for identity, and her neighbor Brian loves her from afar. Winnie Holzman created the most honest teen drama: one season that defined the genre.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Claire Danes as Angela: the face of teenage confusion, perfectly capturing the intensity of 15. Jared Leto as Jordan Catalano: the crush who barely speaks. A.J. Langer as Rayanne, Wilson Cruz as Rickie, Devon Sawa as Brian. The performances are raw, real, and unforgettable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Liberty High School and the Chase household: the lockers, the bedrooms, the hallways, the parties. The world is 1994 America captured before the internet changed everything. The details are specific and true.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>1990s network TV aesthetics: functional, focused on performance. The style doesn't distinguish—but the writing makes every frame feel observed. The look is dated; the emotion is timeless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is teenagers in high school: classrooms, hallways, bedrooms. The "spectacle" is emotional—the intensity of first love, first betrayal, first understanding. No budget, all truth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Adolescence, identity, parents who don't understand, friendships that change, the intensity of feelings that adults dismiss. The show takes teenage emotion seriously—it was the first. The themes are universal and specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Angela and Jordan, Angela and Rayanne, Angela and her parents. The drive is emotional—each episode explores a moment of growing up. The structure is episodic with serialized feelings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>One season, cancelled. 19 episodes of perfection, but incomplete. Angela's story was meant to continue—it didn't. The finale leaves everything unresolved. What exists is flawless; what's missing hurts.</p>
