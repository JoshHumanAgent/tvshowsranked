            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The CIA's Lioness program infiltrates terrorist networks through women close to targets. Cruz Manuelos is recruited into the program. Zoe Saldaña is Joe, the station chief; Nicole Kidman plays her supervisor. Taylor Sheridan creates spy thriller as Taylor Sheridan: personal cost, professional stakes, Montana values.

                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Personal cost of service, family vs. mission, the women who do the work men can't, loyalty and betrayal. The show explores these through Cruz's infiltration and Joe's management.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">

                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
