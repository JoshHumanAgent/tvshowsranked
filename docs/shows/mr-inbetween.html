            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Ray Shoesmith is a hitman. He's also a father, a brother, a friend. He tries to balance work and life in suburban Sydney. Scott Ryan created and stars: the mundane violence, the dark comedy, the human hitman. Like Barry but Australian, darker, more human.</p>
            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Scott Ryan as Ray: the hitman you root for, violent and vulnerable. The supporting cast creates his world—daughter, brother, friends, targets. Ryan's performance is lived-in, real.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Suburban Sydney: the houses, the schools, the everyday places where Ray conducts his violence. The world is normal—Ray's work is the anomaly. Australian crime minimalism.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>FX production: handheld, observational, the violence sudden and brutal. The style is invisible—this is character, not spectacle. The 22-minute episodes are perfect.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is violence: quick, brutal, matter-of-fact. Ray's work is choreographed for reality, not excitement. The "spectacle" is the contrast between work and life.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Work-life balance for monsters, whether violence can be compartmentalized, what we owe to family vs. work, the human face of killers. The show explores these through dark comedy.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Ray's work, Ray's family, Ray's attempts to be both. The structure is slice-of-life crime—episodes are 22 minutes of work-life balance for a hitman. The drive is Ray's humanity.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Three seasons, complete. Ray's story concludes with appropriate darkness. The ending is inevitable but earned. 26 episodes of perfect crime comedy-drama.</p></div>
