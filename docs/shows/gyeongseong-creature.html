            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1945 Gyeongseong (Seoul under Japanese occupation). A pawnshop owner and a sleuth investigate a series of disappearances. They discover a hospital where the Japanese military is conducting horrific experiments. There's something in the basement. Park Seo-joon and Han So-hee star in the Korean period horror-thriller: historical trauma meets creature feature.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Park Seo-joon as Jang Tae-sang: the pawnshop owner drawn into the mystery. Han So-hee as Yoon Chae-ok: the sleuth searching for her mother. The performances ground the horror in character. The Japanese villains are effectively terrifying.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1945 Gyeongseong: Japanese occupation, Korean resistance, the hospital where experiments happen. The world is historically grounded—the occupation is rendered with detail. The horror emerges from real history.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix Korean production: 1945 Seoul photographed with period detail, the hospital as house of horrors, the creature revealed slowly. The style is atmospheric—historical drama meets creature horror.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The creature, the experiments, the period action. The horror is both human (occupation atrocities) and monster (the experiment results). The spectacle is deployed with purpose.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Japanese war crimes, occupation trauma, what humanity means, survival at any cost. The show explores Korea's colonial history through horror metaphor. The creature is born from real horror.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The mystery of the hospital, the disappearances, the creature. The structure is survival horror—discovery, escape, confrontation. The pacing builds tension effectively.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, ongoing. Season 1 resolves its immediate story; season 2 continues into present day. The creature's origin is revealed but the story continues. Incomplete.</p>
