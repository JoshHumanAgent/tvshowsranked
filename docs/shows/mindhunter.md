## The Landscape

The late 1970s. The FBI is just beginning to understand serial killers. Holden Ford wants to talk to them. Bill Tench wants to categorize them. And the monsters they interview will change how we understand evil.

## The Characters

Holden: the arrogant agent who thinks he's smarter than murderers. Bill: the veteran keeping it together. Dr. Wendy Carr: the academic who provides the framework. And the killers: Kemper, Manson, BTK—portrayed with unsettling humanity.

## What It Feels Like

Like a horror film wrapped in a procedural. Like watching David Fincher turn his exacting eye to television. Like understanding that evil isn't banal—it's specific, particular, and terrifyingly human.

## The Fincher Touch

Every frame is composed. Every scene is deliberate. This is filmmaking as precision instrument.
