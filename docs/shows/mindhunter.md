## What It Feels Like to Watch

Mindhunter is a chilling exploration of the criminal mind, produced by David Fincher. Set in the late 1970s, it follows two FBI agents who interview imprisoned serial killers to understand active ones.

You watch Mindhunter and feel the psychological weight. This isn't action-driven crime solving—it's slow, deliberate exploration of why people do terrible things. The interviews with Edmund Kemper, Dennis Rader, and others are fascinating and disturbing.

The atmosphere is everything. Fincher's precise direction creates a cold, clinical tone that suits the material perfectly. Every frame is composed, every scene measured.

But the series is also about the cost of this work. Holden Ford and Bill Tench become consumed by their investigations. The job changes them in ways they can't fully understand.
