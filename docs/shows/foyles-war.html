            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Hastings, Sussex, during World War II and after. Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle wants to fight in the war; instead he's assigned to solve murders at home. The war permeates everything—black marketeers, draft dodgers, profiteers, spies, collaborators. Michael Kitchen is Foyle: quiet, methodical, morally unshakeable, the war as backdrop to his cases. Anthony Horowitz created a procedural with historical depth—each mystery reveals something about wartime England, each solution exposes the cost of conflict.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Michael Kitchen's Foyle is masterful: understated, ironic, impossible to read until he's solved the case. Honeysuckle Weeks as his driver Sam provides warmth and pluck. Anthony Howell as Sergeant Milner is the wounded veteran learning investigation. The guest casts feature the best of British television. Kitchen's restraint is the show's engine—what he doesn't say matters as much as what he does.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Wartime England rendered in forensic detail: rationing, blackout, evacuation, the home front's daily struggles. The mysteries explore war's moral complexity—conscientious objectors, Italian internees, Jewish refugees, American servicemen. Each case reveals a different facet of WWII Britain. The world is educational without being didactic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Period accuracy in every frame: costumes, vehicles, architecture, the quality of light. The cinematography serves the historical setting without ostentation. The mysteries are staged clearly; the solutions are visible to attentive viewers. Traditional detective drama aesthetics, executed with care.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is thoughtful detection in a specific time: interviews, evidence gathering, the gradual accumulation of truth. The war provides backdrop, not action sequences. The spectacle is moral: watching Foyle navigate corruption at home while war rages abroad.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each mystery explores wartime ethics: the black market as survival strategy, the pacifist as coward or hero, the profiteer as capitalist or traitor. Foyle's moral clarity contrasts with wartime's moral complexity. The show asks what justice means when the world is burning. Intellectual depth in genre format.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode is feature-length, a complete mystery with investigation, suspects, solution. The drive is procedural—Foyle discovers clues, interviews witnesses, reaches conclusions. The serialized elements (war progression, character relationships) provide continuity. Not propulsive; methodical. Appropriate to the material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show evolved from wartime to postwar (MI5), each phase appropriate to its era. The final episode provides closure for Foyle's arc—retirement, peace, the cases behind him. Twenty-eight episodes across 13 years; the ending respects the journey. A complete body of work.</p>
