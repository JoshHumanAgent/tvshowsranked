## What It Feels Like to Watch

A mathematician predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire — a thousand-year reign that will end in 500 years of barbarism. To preserve knowledge, he creates a plan: the Foundation, a repository of human knowledge that will help rebuild civilization after the collapse.

This is the most ambitious television project in years — an adaptation of Isaac Asimov's landmark novel series. Apple TV+ has spared no expense: the production values are cinematic, the cast is exceptional, and the scope is massive.

The story follows multiple timelines: the Empire under Emperor Cleon (Lee Pace is magnificent); the Foundation's founding by Hari Seldon (Jared Harris); and the future as the Foundation grows into a power.

It's not a direct adaptation — the show has made significant changes, adding original characters and plotlines. Some fans of the books have criticized these changes; others have appreciated the fresh take.

What makes the show work is its ambition. This is television that tries to tackle big ideas — the nature of power, the role of knowledge in civilization, the unpredictability of history. It doesn't always succeed, but it's always interesting.
