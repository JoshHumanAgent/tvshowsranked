            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">WeCrashed tells the story of WeWork and its founders, Adam and Rebekah Neumann, and it's a study in the particular kind of madness that capitalism enables when charisma meets credulity. Jared Leto plays Adam Neumann as someone who believes his own nonsense so thoroughly that others can't help but believe it too—a prophet of "community" whose community happens to be rented desks in poorly soundproofed offices. Anne Hathaway plays Rebekah as a different kind of believer: privileged, spiritual, certain that her husband's success is evidence of cosmic alignment.</p>

            <p>The show captures the surreal energy of the WeWork rise—the parties, the projections, the way otherwise intelligent people convinced themselves that offices were a lifestyle brand. It's less interested in explaining the fraud than in understanding the atmosphere that made it possible. How did investors pour billions into a company whose fundamentals didn't support a fraction of its valuation? By believing the story rather than the numbers, and the show is very good at showing how good Adam was at telling stories.</p>

            <p>Where WeCrashed falters is in making the Neumanns the center of everything. The employees, the investors, the thousands of people whose jobs and savings were affected by the crash remain peripheral to the saga of two very rich people who got slightly less rich. The finale's attempt to generate sympathy for their downfall feels unearned—they lost a billion dollars, but they still had a billion dollars. But as a study in how bubbles form and burst, and in the personality disorders that thrive in certain economic conditions, WeCrashed is effective, uncomfortable viewing.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>WeCrashed earns its ranking through committed performances and a willingness to let its subjects be unlikable without trying to explain them away. The score reflects a business drama that's compelling without being morally confused about its subjects.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Jared Leto disappears into Adam Neumann—the Israeli accent, the physical gestures, the manic energy that could read as visionary or unhinged depending on who's watching. Anne Hathaway captures Rebekah's particular mix of spirituality and entitlement. The performances make these people watchable even when they're infuriating.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The startup world is rendered with attention to its specific culture—the parties, the jargon, the way reality gets suspended in the name of vision. The WeWork offices themselves become a kind of character, spaces designed to make people feel they're part of something. The show captures what it felt like to be inside a particular moment in tech history.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach is competent business-drama aesthetic: boardrooms, parties, private jets. The direction serves the actors rather than competing with them. There are moments of visual flair—the launch events, the conferences—but mostly the show trusts its material to generate interest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle here is financial rather than visual—billions of dollars in valuation appearing and disappearing. There are no effects or action sequences. The visual interest is in watching people talk in various expensive rooms.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages with questions about value, belief, and the stories that capitalism tells itself. How do we decide what something is worth? What happens when story replaces reality? The Neumanns are less interesting as con artists than as symptoms of a system that rewarded their particular delusions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The rise and fall structure provides natural momentum, and the eight-episode count keeps things focused. Each installment advances the story—from scrappy startup to global phenomenon to implosion—without overextending. The pacing is the inverse of the subject's arc: controlled where WeWork was chaotic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending is known in advance for anyone who followed the news, which limits surprise but allows the show to focus on how rather than what. The Neumanns' departure is portrayed with an attempt at pathos that doesn't quite land—they leave with enormous wealth while laying off thousands. The show doesn't fully resolve the tension between character study and critique.</p>
