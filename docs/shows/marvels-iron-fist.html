<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Danny Rand returns to New York after 15 years presumed dead, trained in K'un-Lun as the Iron Fist, immortal weapon. His family's company has been stolen from him, his childhood friends don't recognize him, and he wants to use his powers for... something. Marvel's Iron Fist arrived at peak Netflix-Marvel expectations and disappointed everyone: the fights were choppy, the philosophy was superficial, the corporate intrigue was boring. Finn Jones plays Danny as privileged hippie who happened to learn kung fu—charming but shallow. Jessica Henwick's Colleen Wing is the heart; her arc from dojo owner to Hand member is the most interesting story the show tells. The Hand, the Meachums, K'un-Lun mythology—all exist without connecting. Danny is supposed to be the world's greatest martial artist. The show didn't cast a martial artist. Watch for the Danny/Colleen relationship; endure the corporate drama.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (6/10)</h3><p>Finn Jones is miscast—Danny plays as naive rich kid, not disciplined warrior. Jessica Henwick's Colleen Wing is the MVP: her arc, her fighting, her struggle. The Meachum family (David Wenham, Tom Pelphrey, Jessica Stroup) provides corporate villainy without depth. The Hand is recycled from Daredevil without invention.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (5.5/10)</h3><p>K'un-Lun is mentioned more than shown. The corporate world is bland. The Hand's plans for New York remain vague. The show doesn't build a world—it borrows pieces from better shows.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>The fight choreography was criticized from release. Finn Jones wasn't a martial artist; the editing hides what should be shown. The hallway fight tradition from Daredevil limps here. Colleen Wing's dojo scenes have more authentic choreography.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>The Iron Fist effect—glowing hand—looks fine. The fighting should be the spectacle and falls short. K'un-Lun glimpses in season 2 don't compensate for season 1's corporate offices.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3><p>Danny's struggle between duty and desire, corporate legacy versus spiritual training. Immortal weapon protecting a gate to another dimension. The themes are present but the show doesn't make them matter. Danny often seems to not care about either.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (5.5/10)</h3><p>Danny's return, corporate takeover, Hand infiltration—threads compete without integrating. The pacing is slow. By season 2, the show finds momentum but loses its audience. The Defenders crossover improves Danny's character; Iron Fist alone is rough.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>Two seasons before cancellation. Season 1 resolves Danny's identity crisis and Hand plot. Season 2 shifts tone, improves fights, but ends on cliffhanger after cancellation. Watch if completing the Netflix Marvel run; skip otherwise.</p></div></section>
