            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Will McAvoy is a news anchor who stops being polite and starts being real. Jeff Daniels is the anchor; Aaron Sorkin is the voice. The show follows a cable news team trying to do journalism in an industry that prefers entertainment. The Sorkin trademarks are all present: walk-and-talks, rapid-fire dialogue, idealistic speeches, romantic entanglements among coworkers. HBO production values meet The West Wing's spiritual successor.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jeff Daniels as Will McAvoy is Sorkin's muse: articulate, angry, idealistic. Emily Mortimer as MacKenzie is his producer and former lover—chaotic, brilliant, emotionally volatile. The ensemble (John Gallagher Jr., Alison Pill, Thomas Sadoski, Dev Patel) provides the Sorkin chorus. The performances are kinetic; Sorkin's dialogue demands precision.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Cable news as Sorkin sees it: a platform for civic information, corrupted by ratings pressure and corporate ownership. The newsroom is a complete ecosystem: the control room, the anchor desk, the conference rooms. The show integrates real news events (the BP oil spill, the Tucson shooting, the 2012 election) as story drivers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production: the newsroom looks real, the control room is functional, the lighting is appropriate. The style serves Sorkin's dialogue—camera moves to follow conversations. Competent without distinction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle—this is people talking in rooms, extremely articulately. The "action" is breaking news: graphics, countdown timers, live feeds. The spectacle is intellectual rather than visual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Journalism ethics, corporate media, the responsibility of news organizations, the tension between profit and public service. Sorkin argues for journalism as civic duty, and argues against those who disagree. The show is a polemic—sometimes didactic, always articulate. Whether you agree with Sorkin's politics, the density is undeniable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Sorkin structure: personal dramas intercut with professional crises, building to climactic broadcasts. The drive is the news cycle—something is always breaking, decisions must be made. The romantic entanglements provide serial momentum. Episode structure is reliable; the show knows its formula.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons with conclusion. The final season tackles corporate takeover and journalist protection. McAvoy and MacKenzie resolve their romantic arc. The show ends with the team still fighting for good journalism. Sorkin shows know when to stop; this one stopped appropriately.</p>
