            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Five young offenders doing community service get struck by lightning during a storm. They develop superpowers—but they're not heroes, they're delinquents. Kelly can hear thoughts, Curtis can rewind time, Alisha makes people crave her, Simon can turn invisible, Nathan is... Nathan. Howard Overman created the anti-superhero show: superpowers as curse, community service as purgatory, British bleak humor as superpower.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The original cast is iconic: Lauren Socha as Kelly, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as Curtis, Antonia Thomas as Alisha, Iwan Rheon as Simon, and Robert Sheehan as Nathan—the chaotic, immortal, unbearable Nathan. When Sheehan left, Joseph Gilgun's Rudy joined. The performances define the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The estate, the community center, the superpowers as everyday curse. The world expands as others develop powers and the government takes notice. The setting is British sink estate realism meets superhero absurdity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>E4 production: the community center, the grey skies, the orange jumpsuits. The style is British comedy—functional, focused on character. The superpowers are rendered with budget but creativity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the powers used for petty purposes: invisibility for theft, time travel for do-overs, mind reading for awkward revelations. The spectacle is ironic—the powers are curses, not gifts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Superpowers as curse, community service as redemption, whether people can change, the pointlessness of heroism. The show subverts superhero tropes by giving powers to people who don't want them and won't use them responsibly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic adventures with serialized character development: each episode brings a new superpower problem or opportunity. The structure is British comedy—situation, escalation, consequence. The pacing is relentless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with cast turnover. The original cast left; the replacements were good but different. The show ended with season 5, but the magic was in seasons 1-2. Nathan's departure changed the show fundamentally.</p>
