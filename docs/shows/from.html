            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A town you can't leave. A road that loops back. Creatures that come at night, wearing smiles, asking to be let in. The residents of this impossible place have established routines: stay inside after dark, don't open the door, survive together. Then a new family arrives, and the equilibrium shifts. Stephen King's cosmic horror meets Lost's mystery-box; the showrunners worked on both. Small-town America as trap, community as survival, the dark as patient predator.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Harold Perrineau as Boyd Stevens, the sheriff who maintains order. Eion Bailey as the father trying to protect his family. Hannah Cheramy, Chloe Van Landschoot, and the ensemble create a community of survivors. The performances are solid; the terror is conveyed through restraint. No weak links, though no one steals the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The town as trap: houses, diner, clinic, the surrounding forest. Rules established: don't go out at night, the trees have meaning, the talismans work. The mystery extends—what is this place? Why these people? The world expands each season: underground tunnels, a lighthouse, the creatures' nature. The world is complete and terrifying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Daylight as safety, darkness as threat. The show uses light strategically—golden hour scenes of mundane community, pitch-black scenes of terror. The creatures are glimpsed rather than shown, their smiles more frightening than any monster. The visual language creates dread through suggestion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Horror spectacle: the creatures at the windows, the blood, the narrow escapes. The budget shows in creature design—they're effective but not iconic. The spectacle is atmospheric: the forest, the town, the darkness that arrives like clockwork. Television horror executed competently.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Trapped communities, the nature of evil, the meaning of sacrifice. The show explores how people organize under threat: hierarchies form, rules are enforced, faith is tested. The mystery of the town—what it is, why it exists—provides ongoing conceptual engagement. Demanding but rewarding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic survival with serialized mystery. Each episode brings new information: about the town, the creatures, the residents. The showrunners learned from Lost—questions are answered even as new ones appear. The drive is constant: what is this place? How do they escape? Propulsive horror.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The mystery continues to expand without clear resolution trajectory. Whether the showrunners have an ending planned is unknown. The risk of Lost-style disappointment is real. Currently maintaining quality; ending will determine ultimate ranking.</p>
