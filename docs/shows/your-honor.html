            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Judge Michael Desiato's son kills someone in a hit-and-run. The victim is the son of a mob boss. To protect his child, the judge does everything he condemned others for: he lies, he destroys evidence, he becomes what he prosecuted. Bryan Cranston is Desiato—moral authority crumbling in real time. The Israeli adaptation (Kvodo) expanded into a showcase for Cranston's ability to play descent.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Bryan Cranston carries the show: the judge who becomes a criminal, the father who destroys to protect. Hunter Doohan as Adam provides the son who becomes collateral in his own survival. Michael Stuhlbarg as the mob boss is terrifying and human. The performances are prestige-TV quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>New Orleans: the courthouse, the projects, the mob territory. The city is specific—the hurricane history, the racial politics, the corruption. The world serves Desiato's descent rather than existing independently.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Showtime production: New Orleans photographed with appropriate darkness, the judge's chambers contrasting with the streets. The style serves the thriller—shadow, light, the moral descent visualized.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is moral descent: a judge destroying his life one decision at a time. The "spectacle" is watching Cranston disintegrate. Thriller without action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The criminal justice system, the lie that grows, the impossibility of protecting family legally when the law is against you, whether good people become bad or merely reveal what they always were. The show explores moral disintegration as inevitability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Every decision creates a new problem; every cover-up requires another cover-up. The drive is relentless: one wrong choice leads to ten more. The tension never releases. Binge television in the purest sense.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons. The first season was planned as complete; the second was added later. The first season's ending is devastating; the second season provides continuation. The complete story is satisfying with or without season 2.</p>
