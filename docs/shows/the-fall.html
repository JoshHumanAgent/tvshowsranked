            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Belfast. Paul Spector is a grief counselor who murders women. Stella Gibson is a Metropolitan Police detective brought in to review a case. She realizes the murders are connected. Gillian Anderson is Gibson—cold, methodical, brilliant. Jamie Dornan is Spector—handsome, domestic, deadly. The cat-and-mouse game is slow, patient, clinical. One of the most disturbing portraits of evil on television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Gillian Anderson's Stella Gibson is iconic: the silk blouses, the control, the sexuality she owns, the intelligence. Jamie Dornan's Paul Spector is terrifying because he's ordinary—the man next door who kills. The performances are the show. Anderson and Dornan as predator and predator.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Belfast: the city, the police department, the domestic spaces Spector invades. The world is specific—Northern Ireland's geography and politics provide background. The murder scenes are clinical, not sensationalized. The world serves the cat-and-mouse.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Allan Cubitt's direction is patient and deliberate: long takes, clinical framing, the violence shown with restraint. The style is cold—matching Gibson's demeanor. Belfast is photographed in muted tones. The visual language is distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is absence: violence implied, bodies discovered, the clinical aftermath. The show resists sensationalism deliberately. This is psychological thriller, not procedurally violent. The "spectacle" is performance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Female agency, the male gaze, the psychology of predation, whether violence is chosen or inherent. Gibson is a woman investigating crimes against women, in a police force of men. The show explores misogyny without lecturing. The themes are sophisticated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The chase is slow but constant: Gibson builds her case, Spector continues his life. The tension is in the patience—we know who he is, when will she catch him? The pacing is deliberate; the rewards are psychological.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, complete. The pursuit ends; Spector is caught; the aftermath is explored. The third season is weaker than the first two—the show wasn't designed for continuation. The ending is appropriate; the original concept was stronger.</p>
