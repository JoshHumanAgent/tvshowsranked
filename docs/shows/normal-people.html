            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Normal People is an adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel about two Irish teenagers who see each other clearly when no one else does, carry that connection through university, and make each other miserable and whole in equal measure. Marianne is wealthy, lonely, and acts like she doesn't care what others think. Connell is working-class, popular, and terrified of being perceived as different. Their relationship becomes the story of young adulthood—intimacy that comes and goes, miscommunication, growth that happens together and apart.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes Normal People is its absolute focus on interiority. The show uses voiceover from the novel's close-third narration to give us what the characters can't say out loud. The camera stays close—the intimacy of faces in conversation is the entire visual strategy. Director Lenny Abrahamson established this approach in Room, and here it serves the material perfectly: we are in Marianne's and Connell's heads, experiencing their misreadings of each other, their simultaneous closeness and distance.</p>

            <p>Paul Mescal's Connell became a breakout performance, wearing the anxiety of class and masculinity in every moment of physical awkwardness. Daisy Edgar-Jones's Marianne is more confident on the surface but equally damaged beneath, and the show traces how their relationship reshapes both. The sex scenes, choreographed by an intimacy coordinator in one of the first high-profile uses of such a role, are about vulnerability and communication rather than titillation. The twelve episodes capture the novel's emotional trajectory—two people who can't stop loving each other despite everything.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Normal People earns its ranking through intimacy of direction, performances that captured a generation, and fidelity to emotional truth over plot. The score reflects one of the best literary adaptations in recent memory.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones give performances that feel lived rather than acted—every hesitation, every miscommunication registers as genuine. Supporting characters orbit the central relationship without overwhelming it. The show is built on these two faces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Irish small town and Dublin university are rendered with class specificity. Marianne's house is wealthy and cold; Connell's is modest and warm. The settings reflect the characters' interiors. Geography matters less than interior space.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3e>
                <p>Extreme close-ups create intimacy that mirrors emotional exposure. The framing serves the closeness—face, shoulders, hands. The twelve episodes feel like one sustained mood. Some viewers found the approach excessive; others found it precisely right.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3e>
                <p>No spectacle of any kind. The visual interest is entirely in faces and bodies. This is a show about looking at people and being looked at in return.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores communication and its failures, class and its manifestations, how intimacy can both heal and wound. The ideas emerge from character rather than being imposed. Rooney's novel provides the philosophical ground; the adaptation finds dramatic form.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The story follows the relationship episodically—together, apart, together again. Some viewers found the pacing slow; others found it patient. The plot is minimal by design; the interest is in emotional progression rather than event.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7.5/10)</h3e>
                <p>The conclusion provides appropriate resolution: both characters have grown, but the question of whether they can sustain happiness remains open. The show trusts its audience to accept uncertainty. The ending honors the novel's refusal of easy resolution.</p>
