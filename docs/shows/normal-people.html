<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Connell and Marianne go to the same school. He's popular; she's a loner. They have sex. They don't tell anyone. They love each other and can't say it. Sally Rooney's novel adapted: millennial romance as miscommunication, intimacy as vulnerability, two people learning to be together.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Paul Mescal as Connell: the working-class boy at university. Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne: the middle-class girl who feels different. Their chemistry is electric. The sex scenes are filmed with rare honesty.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Small-town Ireland, then Trinity College Dublin. The class differences, the friend groups, the parties, the isolation. The world is specific to millennial Ireland.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>BBC/Hulu production: intimate close-ups, silence as communication, the landscape of longing. The style is observation—watching two people fail to connect.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is young love: misunderstandings, silences, sex that matters. The "spectacle" is emotional—the intensity of not saying what you feel.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Class and love, intimacy as risk, whether we can be seen, communication vs. miscommunication, mental health in relationships. The show explores these with precision.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Every few episodes: together, apart, together, apart. The structure is relationship—will they say what they mean? The drive is hope they will.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The ending is right for the story—not definitive, but earned. Millennial romance at its most honest.</p></div></section>
