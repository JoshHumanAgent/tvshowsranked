## What It Feels Like to Watch

For All Mankind takes a simple premise—what if the space race never ended?—and builds an emotional epic spanning decades. It's the most ambitious alternate history series ever made, and it's surprisingly moving.

The series begins in 1969. The Apollo 11 mission is about to launch. But Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov reaches the lunar surface first, and suddenly America is behind. What follows is a transformed history where the space race continues with renewed intensity, pushing NASA to innovate faster, dream bigger, and pay higher costs.

The ensemble is exceptional. Joel Kinnaman as Ed Baldwin provides the anchor—a NASA astronaut whose ambition drives the series. The supporting cast includes brilliant actors playing engineers, astronauts, and their families.

What makes For All Mankind special is its emotional core. It's not just about rockets and missions—it's about sacrifice. Characters die. Marriages fail. Children grow up without parents. The cost of reaching the stars is measured in human lives.

The production is stunning. The attention to period detail—cars, fashion, technology—is meticulous. The space sequences are beautiful, grounded in real physics.

Four seasons in, the show has evolved from alternate history to something else entirely. It's now a story about humanity's future in space, about the choices we make to survive.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.70**

**Strengths:**
- **Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman)**: The anchor of the series. Kinnaman brings complexity to this ambitious astronaut—his compromises and growth feel real.

- **Tracy Stevens (Sarah Jones)**: One of television's most compelling female astronauts. Jones brings strength and vulnerability.
- **Margo Madison (Wren)**: The brilliant engineer. Wren's character evolves from support to leadership.
- **Karen Baldwin (Michele Weaver)**: Ed's wife whose tragedy drives much of the emotional story.
- **The next generation**: Season 3-4 introduces new astronauts who carry the story forward.

**Weaknesses:**
