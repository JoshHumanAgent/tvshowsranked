## What It Feels Like to Watch

Imagine if you could separate your work life from your personal life completely. Not just mentally — surgically. Your "work self" remembers nothing of your home life. Your "home self" remembers nothing of work. When you leave the office, you have no memory of what happened there. When you arrive, you have no memory of your life outside.

That's the premise of *Severance*, and it's as unsettling as it sounds.

The show is set at Lumon Industries, a company so secretive that employees undergo the "severance" procedure to work there. Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team of "severed" workers who spend their days in a sterile, retro-futuristic office doing work they don't understand for reasons they can't comprehend.

Ben Stiller directs with a visual style that's simultaneously beautiful and oppressive. The Lumon offices are all clean lines, soft colors, and uncanny emptiness. The employees move through spaces that feel like a corporate nightmare — everything is pleasant, everything is wrong.

The mystery unfolds with deliberate patience. What is Lumon actually doing? Why does the work matter? Who are these people, really? The show trusts you to follow without hand-holding, and the revelations are genuinely surprising.

The cast is exceptional. Adam Scott plays Mark with a quiet desperation — a man grieving his wife who has chosen to forget his grief for eight hours a day. John Turturro and Christopher Walken bring pathos to their roles as older employees who have been severed so long they've lost track of who they were. Patricia Arquette is terrifying as the boss who maintains the system.

This is television as puzzle box, but one with genuine emotional stakes. It's about work, identity, grief, and the parts of ourselves we try to cut away.
