            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The future is dying. Consciousness transfer technology allows agents to project back into the bodies of present-day people moments before their historical deaths. The travelers take over, prevent the death, and continue the host's life while pursuing missions to prevent the apocalypse. Brad Wright's creation is sci-fi as workplace drama: five teammates in borrowed bodies, maintaining cover while changing history. The premise is audacious; the execution is grounded.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Eric McCormack as Grant MacLaren, the team leader whose host had a failing marriage. MacKenzie Porter, Nesta Cooper, Jared Abrahamson, and Reilly Dolman as teammates navigating host lives and mission directives. The acting challenge: playing future agents impersonating present-day people. The ensemble pulls it off with consistency. Character development earns investment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The rules: travelers arrive seconds before their hosts' recorded deaths; they have mission briefs but limited information; the future is changing as they succeed or fail. The show explores consequences—if you save someone, what happens to their family? What happens to the relationships? The world is logically consistent within its premises.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Canadian TV production: Vancouver as everywhere, functional effects, competent direction. The show doesn't have cinematic ambition; it has narrative ambition. The sci-fi elements (consciousness transfer, future interventions) are suggested rather than spectacular. Style serves story.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Limited spectacle: the future is glimpsed through communication, not visited. The spectacle is conceptual—watching people pretend to be other people, watching history change. The budget constraints are visible but not fatal. Ideas over spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Time travel paradox, identity, the ethics of body theft, whether changing the past changes you. The show asks: if you're sent to save the future, can you still have a present? The travelers become attached to their hosts' lives; missions conflict with humanity. The philosophy is baked into every episode.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic missions with serialized consequences. Each episode brings a mission; each mission changes something; each change affects the travelers. The structure allows both procedural satisfaction and long-term momentum. The showrunners planned ahead—threads planted early pay off late. Addictive binge television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons with planned conclusion. The finale resets the timeline—the travelers never came back, the mission never happened. It's a brave ending: everything they did was erased, but the potential for change remains. The ending honors the premise. Complete.</p>
