<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Behind the scenes at CSC, a cable sports network, where a team produces a nightly sports show. Aaron Sorkin's first television series—before The West Wing, before The Newsroom—shows his signature emerging: walk-and-talks, rapid dialogue, workplace-as-family, idealists fighting corporate compromise. Peter Krause plays anchor Casey McCall, trying to be professional while divorced and middle-aged; Josh Charles plays Dan Rydell, recovering from depression; Felicity Huffman is executive producer Dana Whitaker, competent and overwhelmed. The show aired on ABC with laugh track and studio audience; Sorkin fought both. The studio won. Watch it without the laugh track and you see the drama Sorkin intended. It's funny—genuinely—but it's not a sitcom. It's about people who love their work and each other, failing upward at a job that will consume them.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8.5/10)</h3><p>Peter Krause and Josh Charles have chemistry that reads as years of friendship. Felicity Huffman's Dana is the show's emotional center—competent, insecure, trying to run a show and a life. Sabrina Lloyd's Natalie and Josh Malina's Jeremy provide romantic subplot. Robert Guillaume's Isaac Jaffe is the professional father figure. The cast makes Sorkin's dialogue sing.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>The CSC network is corporate bureaucracy; the show-within-a-show is chaotic professionalism. 1990s cable television feels authentic (because it was close to Sorkin's experience). The sports world is present but secondary—the show is about production, not athletics.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6.5/10)</h3><p>Multi-camera sitcom style with Sorkin's evolving ambition. The walk-and-talk becomes signature. The show is blocked for comedy timing that doesn't match the dramatic content. The Sorkin style—visible in later work—struggles with network notes.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>None. Studio sets, production monitors, office furniture. The spectacle is rapid dialogue and emotional honesty. This is theater filmed for television.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Artistic integrity versus commercial pressure. Sorkin's themes—idealism, competence, work as identity—are present but simpler than later work. The workplace-as-family dynamic is warm without being false. The struggle to produce something good in impossible conditions is Sorkin's autobiography.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Show production provides weekly structure; relationship arcs provide emotional continuity. Sorkin writes weekly without planning—sometimes brilliant, sometimes filler. Casey-Dana unresolved tension keeps momentum. The show fights format and wins occasionally.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Cancelled after two seasons. The finale addresses cancellation by having the show within the show face cancellation. Casey and Dana finally get together. Isaac faces health issues. Sorkin moved to The West Wing; the cast dispersed. The ending is premature but not incomplete.</p></div></section>
