            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Jane Rizzoli is a Boston homicide detective. Maura Isles is the medical examiner. They're best friends who solve murders together. Tess Gerritsen's novels adapted into TNT's long-running procedural: Angie Harmon as Jane (tough, Italian family), Sasha Alexander as Maura (elegant, scientific). The crimes are serious; the friendship is warm. Comfort TV with Boston accents.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander have chemistry that carries the show: tough cop and elegant scientist, opposites who complete each other. The supporting cast (Jordan Bridges, Bruce McGill) provides the team. The performances are procedural-competent—the friendship sells it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Boston homicide: the precinct, the morgue, Rizzoli's Italian family. The world is functional—the friendship is the core, the Boston setting fades in and out. Procedural world-building: sufficient for case-of-the-week.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>TNT procedural aesthetics: functional, bright, designed for syndication. The style is invisible—this is comfort television, not art. The morgue is clinical; Boston is present but not distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is procedural crime: bodies, evidence, interrogations. The "spectacle" is the friendship—watching Jane and Maura banter while solving murders. Comfort television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Friendship, family, work-life balance. The themes are light—the show prioritizes comfort. Jane's Italian family provides occasional depth. This is escapism with warmth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Procedural momentum: case solved each episode, friendship deepens, family provides comedy. The structure is reliable—105 episodes of consistency. The drive is the friendship and the puzzle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Seven seasons with conclusion. Lee Thompson Young's death during production affected the show; they handled it with grace. The finale provided closure. Long-running procedural with appropriate ending.</p>
