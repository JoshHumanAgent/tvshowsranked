## What It Feels Like to Watch

In the town of La Belle, New Mexico, all the men have died in a mining accident — except one, who was away. Now the women run the town, and they're thriving. Then Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his gang of outlaws arrive, chasing a young man named Roy Goode (Jack O'Connell) who betrayed the gang.

*Godless* is a Western without the genre's typical male machismo. It asks: what happens when women run things? The answer is complicated, powerful, and deeply satisfying.

Scott Frank (screenwriter of *Out of Sight*, *Logan*) created this limited series, and it's one of Netflix's most beautiful productions. Filmed on location in New Mexico, every frame looks like a painting. The landscape is a character — vast, unforgiving, magnificent.

The cast is exceptional. Michelle Dockery (*Downton Abbey*) is Alice Fletcher, a woman living in the mountains with her Native American ward, who becomes the unlikely leader of La Belle. Jeff Daniels is terrifying as Frank Griffin — a man who believes he's doing God's work, who calls his victims "sheep" and sees violence as righteousness.

The story unfolds slowly, building tension through character development rather than action. When violence comes, it's brutal and consequential. The final episode is a masterpiece of tension and release.

This is a Western that happens to feature women at its center, and it's all the better for it.
