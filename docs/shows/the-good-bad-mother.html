            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Young-soon raised her son Kang-ho alone on a pig farm in rural Korea. She was hard on him—beating, berating, demanding he become a prosecutor. He became one, but he grew cold and distant. Then an accident leaves him with the mind of a seven-year-old. He returns to the farm; she cares for him; they both learn what went wrong. Ra Mi-ran and Lee Do-hyun deliver devastating performances. A mother-son story about damage and repair.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Ra Mi-ran as Young-soon is monumental: the hard mother who can't express love, the woman whose cruelty came from trauma. Lee Do-hyun as Kang-ho transforms twice—before the accident (cold prosecutor) and after (childlike, learning). The performances are K-drama acting at its finest: emotional, detailed, devastating.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Rural Korea: the pig farm, the village, the traditions, the poverty. Young-soon's world is specific—a single mother in a judgmental village, a farmer whose son is her ticket out. The world is rendered with care; the farming life is real.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama rural aesthetic: green fields, the farm, the village gatherings. The style is warm when Kang-ho is present, harsh in flashbacks. The photography supports the emotional beats without calling attention to itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. Farm life, family drama, emotional confrontation. The "spectacle" is acting—watching a mother and son find each other after decades of damage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Motherhood, sacrifice, the damage done "for your own good," the possibility of repair when the mind resets. The show explores whether a bad mother can become good, whether a cold son can become warm, whether trauma can be undone. Heavy themes handled with K-drama emotion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The accident happens early; the rest is repair. Kang-ho regresses and slowly recovers; Young-soon learns to be the mother she couldn't be. The pacing is classic K-drama: emotional beats, revelations, tearful resolutions. The drive is toward understanding and forgiveness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete in 14 episodes. The mother-son relationship resolves; the past is forgiven; the ending is earned. K-drama structure at its best: a complete story with emotional payoff.</p>
