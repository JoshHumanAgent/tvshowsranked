## What It Feels Like to Watch

In a dystopian future, the United States has become Gilead — a totalitarian theocracy where women are stripped of rights and reduced to their biological function. One woman, Offred (Elisabeth Moss), serves as a handmaid to a powerful commander and his wife, her sole purpose to bear them children.

This is terrifying television. Based on Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel, the show has extended the story beyond the book, and it's become a commentary on reproductive rights, authoritarianism, and resistance.

Elisabeth Moss is extraordinary as Offred — a woman who has lost everything but refuses to lose herself. The supporting cast is excellent: Yvonne Strahovski as the Commander's wife, Joseph Fiennes as the Commander, and Ann Dowd as Aunt Lydia, a woman who believes she's saving souls while torturing women.

The show is not easy viewing. It depicts sexual violence, oppression, and trauma in unflinching detail. But it's also about resistance — the small acts of rebellion, the human connections that survive oppression, and the hope that refuses to die.

The fifth season ended the story (for now), and it's one of the most important television shows of the decade.
