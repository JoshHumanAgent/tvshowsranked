<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Han So-yeon has prosopagnosia—face blindness. She can't recognize faces, including her own mother's, or remember people from one meeting to the next. Then she gets a pair of smart glasses that project an AI hologram who helps her navigate the world. The AI, Holo, is kind, supportive, and increasingly sentient. His creator, Go Nan-do, is socially awkward genius hiding from the world because his company stole his AI. Yoon Hyun-min plays both: Holo as ideal boyfriend, Nan-do as damaged idealist. My Holo Love asks whether love is recognition or response—whether someone who recognizes her face but can't see her is different from someone who sees her face but can't recognize her. It's Her meets Korean romance, with better chemistry.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3><p>Ko Sung-hee's So-yeon is face-blind, self-protective, slowly opening to connection. Yoon Hyun-min plays dual roles: Holo as idealized warmth, Nan-do as socially damaged creator. The two performances are distinct but connected—Nan-do's isolation explains Holo's need to connect. The romance triangle (AI vs. human) creates genuine tension.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (6.5/10)</h3><p>Near-future Korea: AR glasses in development, AI voice assistants common, corporate espionage in tech. The prosopagnosia is medically accurate, the hologram technology plausible enough. The company hunting Nan-do provides antagonist pressure.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>Modern Seoul with sci-fi overlay. Holo's hologram is rendered into scenes convincingly. The aesthetic is clean, bright, corporate—tech without cyberpunk. So-yeon's perspective is blurred in face sequences, clear otherwise.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>Holo's hologram renders into real environments. Otherwise standard romance aesthetics. The "spectacle" is the premise executed competently.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3><p>Recognition—facial, emotional, AI—is the theme: how do we know someone is who they say they are? What does love require: seeing faces, or being seen? The AI-sentience subplot is less developed than it could be, but the romance is the point.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>The love triangle (woman, AI, creator) creates unusual stakes. The company pursuing Nan-do provides external threat. So-yeon's prosopagnosia creates identity confusion. The plot moves: will she choose the AI that recognizes her or the human who made him?</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Complete story with satisfying resolution. So-yeon accepts both AI and human, the company is defeated, love wins. Korean romance meets sci-fi premise without losing either.</p></div></section>
