            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A gated community in England. Tom Delaney is a surgeon whose wife died a year ago. His daughter goes missing. Then a body is found. The community has secrets: every neighbor, every friend, every relationship has a hidden side. Michael C. Hall (with British accent) is Tom—grieving, searching, discovering people aren't who they seemed. Harlan Coben adaptation: twisty, claustrophobic, everyone's suspicious.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Michael C. Hall carries the series: the grief, the desperation, the gradually revealed secrets of his own. Amanda Abbington, Marc Warren, and Hannah Arterton are the neighbors with secrets. The performances are solid; the British mystery requirements are met.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The gated community: identical houses, perfect lawns, hidden surveillance, secrets behind every door. The world is specific—this is a bubble of safety that isn't safe at all. The setting serves the mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production: the community looks prosperous and claustrophobic, the secrets are rendered in shadow and revelation. The style is mystery-competent without distinguishing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is mystery: interrogations, revelations, secrets uncovered. The "spectacle" is the twist—watching what you thought you knew change.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Safe spaces and the danger within them, how well we know the people closest to us, grief and its distortions. The themes are present in the setup; the resolution prioritizes plot over exploration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight episodes, one mystery. The drive is constant: who took the daughter, who killed the body, what is everyone hiding? The pacing is propulsive—each episode ends with a revelation. Coben's structure is designed for binge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The mystery resolves; the secrets are revealed; the culprit is identified. Coben adaptations are designed for closure. The ending satisfies the promise.</p>
