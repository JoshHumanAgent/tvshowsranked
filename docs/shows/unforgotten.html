            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A body is found—cold case, years or decades old. DCI Cassie Stuart and DI Sunny Khan investigate. Each suspect has a life now; the past threatens to destroy everything. Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar lead Chris Lang's cold-case drama: British crime at its most humane, where the mystery matters less than the lives it upends.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Nicola Walker is Cassie Stuart: the detective who cares too much, whose empathy is both strength and wound. Sanjeev Bhaskar as Sunny Khan provides warmth and stability. The guest casts (each season introduces new suspects) are uniformly excellent. This is character acting elevated to art.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>London and its surroundings: the discovery site, the suspects' current lives, the past that won't stay buried. The world is rendered with specificity—each suspect has a complete life that the investigation threatens. The past is present in every frame.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>ITV production values: London photographed with appropriate grey, the cold-case evidence rendered with care. The style is observational—the camera watches people's lives unravel. The aesthetic serves the emotion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is investigation: interviews, evidence review, lives examined. The "spectacle" is the revelation—watching suspects confront their pasts. British crime at its quietest and most powerful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Memory, guilt, whether the past can be overcome, what we owe to truth vs. what we owe to the living. Each suspect represents a different relationship to the past. The show explores how a single act can ripple across decades. Humane and philosophical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season is a single case: six episodes of investigation, interviews, revelation. The drive is the question—who did it, and why? The pacing allows character development without sacrificing momentum. The structure is perfect for the material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons. Cassie's arc concludes in season 4 (a controversial choice). Season 5 continues with Sunny and new lead. Each season resolves its case; the series provides closure for both leads. Complete on its own terms.</p>
