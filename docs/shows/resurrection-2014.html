            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Resurrection begins with one of the more haunting premises in recent television: people who died years, sometimes decades ago, suddenly return to their small town, unchanged from the moment of their death, with no memory of where they've been. A child who drowned. A mother who died in a car accident. They walk back into lives that have moved on, into families that have grieved and in some cases begun to heal, and they disrupt everything simply by existing.</p>

            <p>The show's strength lies in these intimate moments. A mother seeing her dead son again, now the same age as when she lost him while she has aged decades. A husband whose returned wife discovers he's remarried. A community forced to confront what these returns mean—not scientifically, though that question exists, but emotionally and spiritually. The first season handles this material with restraint, allowing the impossible situation to generate genuine feeling rather than mere spectacle.</p>

            <p>Where Resurrection falters is in its mythology, which gradually overtakes the emotional core. The returned aren't just unexplained; they're connected to a larger conspiracy involving government investigations and perhaps something religious or alien. The mystery elements, meant to provide momentum across twenty-one episodes, instead dilute what made the show compelling. By the time explanations arrive, they feel less interesting than the questions were. The show that began as a meditation on grief and second chances ends as a not-entirely-successful genre exercise.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Resurrection earns its ranking for its premise and first-season execution, held back by mythology that overwhelms its emotional core. The score reflects a show that starts stronger than it finishes, with standout individual moments that don't quite cohere into a satisfying whole.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The emotional scenes require actors to convey complex relationships to people who shouldn't exist, and the cast largely delivers. The returned must play versions of characters who died at different ages; the living must navigate grief, joy, confusion, and sometimes resentment. The performances are strongest in the quiet family moments, less assured when the mythology takes over.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The small-town Missouri setting creates intimacy—the same diner, the same church, the same streets where people run into each other. The government facility that investigates the returned introduces a larger world that feels less authentically rendered. The show is better at family interiors than conspiracy exteriors.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach is serviceable television realism, with occasional moments of genuinely haunting imagery—a child walking down a road he died on thirty years ago, a churchyard where impossible reunions occur. The show doesn't emphasize visual style, but it knows when an image matters.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>There are no effects to speak of; the spectacle is emotional rather than visual. The returned simply appear, unchanged. This restraint serves the material but limits the show's visual vocabulary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The premise invites questions about grief, faith, and the meaning of life and death. What would you do if someone you lost came back? Would it be gift or curse? The show engages seriously with these questions early on, though the mythology eventually displaces them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season maintains momentum through the emotional implications of each return. Later seasons depend more heavily on mystery elements that are less compelling. The pacing remains watchable, but the urgency diminishes as the show runs out of emotional territory and moves into conspiratorial territory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The resolution attempts to explain what the show was better off leaving unexplained. The answers are less interesting than the questions, and the emotional resolution feels rushed. Cancellation after two seasons meant the ending had to compress material, and the result is unsatisfying.</p>
