            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Graduate trainees at a London investment bank. The competition is brutal, the hours are impossible, the drug use is constant, the sex is transactional. Harper is American with secrets; Yasmin is posh and insecure; Robert is partying toward burnout; Eric is the managing director they all want to impress. Finance as warfare, twenty-somethings as cannon fodder, the city as playground and prison. British prestige drama with the filth turned up.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Myha'la Herrold as Harper is the center: brilliant, damaged, impossible to stop watching. Marisa Abela as Yasmin, Harry Lawtey as Robert, Ken Leung as Eric—the ensemble creates a complete social ecosystem. The performances capture the grad-student desperation: the need to succeed, the willingness to sacrifice. No one is sympathetic; everyone is compelling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The trading floor, the after-work drinks, the late-night deals, the client dinners, the weekend escapes. The show captures finance culture: the jargon, the hierarchy, the money, the emptiness beneath. London as global capital rendered with precision. The world is specific, cutthroat, educational.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production values: the offices gleam, the suits fit, the nightlife is rendered in neon. The style is competent; the setting does the work. Trading floors are shot with appropriate chaos; intimate scenes have space to breathe. Functional rather than distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is money: expensive dinners, designer clothes, exclusive clubs. But the show avoids glorifying the lifestyle—the emptiness is always visible. The "spectacle" is behavior pushed to extremes: the drugs, the sex, the self-destruction. Uncomfortable rather than impressive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Meritocracy as myth, the cost of success, class anxiety in British finance. The show explores who survives: Harper's talent, Yasmin's background, Robert's charm—none are sufficient alone. The transactional nature of every relationship, the impossibility of authentic connection. Sophisticated without being academic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The competition format: five trainees, limited positions. Each season has a propulsion—will they survive? The show sustains momentum through professional and personal crises. The pacing is sharp; episodes end with stakes raised. Binge-worthy in the HBO tradition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues to follow the survivors as they advance in their careers. Whether it will reach a conclusion or continue indefinitely is unclear. The trajectory is upward movement without apparent endpoint. Potential unfulfilled or continuing.</p>
