            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Four Indigenous teenagers in rural Oklahoma steal, scheme, and dream of California. They're mourning their friend who died. Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi created the show: Indigenous writers, Indigenous cast, Indigenous stories. Comedy with profound grief underneath.</p>
            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>The ensemble of young actors (Devery Jacobs, D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Paulina Alexis, Lane Factor) creates the friend group. The community around them adds depth. The performances are naturalistic and specific.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>Rural Oklahoma reservation: the community, the struggles, the humor, the history. The world is specific to Indigenous experience—never condescending, always real. One of television's most authentic depictions.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>FX production: rural Oklahoma photographed with affection, the community rendered in detail. The style is observational—this is lived-in, not poverty tourism.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is life: schemes, community, grief, humor. The "spectacle" is the specificity—seeing Indigenous life on television without stereotype.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Grief, community, what we inherit, what we leave, Indigenous identity in modern America, the dream of escape vs. the value of home. The show explores these through comedy that deepens.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>California is the dream: they steal to get money for the trip, they scheme, they plan. The structure is coming-of-age—the drive is adulthood approaching.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Three seasons, complete. The story concludes with characters moving forward. Indigenous storytelling with proper ending. Essential television.</p></div>
