## The Landscape

2% of the world's population disappears in an instant. No explanation. No bodies. Just absence. What remains is grief, cults, and the question: how do you live in a world that no longer makes sense?

## The Characters

Kevin Garvey: the chief who lost his mind. Nora Durst: a woman defined by who she lost. Matt Jamison: the reverend writing scripture to make sense of the senseless. Patti Levin: the cult leader who knows something. Each one searching for meaning in meaninglessness.

## What It Feels Like

Like watching a mystery that refuses to solve itself. Like grief made visible. Like Damon Lindelof learned from LOST's mistakes and made something more honest: not answers, but acceptance.

## International Assassin

Season 2's "International Assassin"—one of television's greatest episodes. A hotel in the afterlife. Identities swapped. A journey through guilt and redemption that defies description.
