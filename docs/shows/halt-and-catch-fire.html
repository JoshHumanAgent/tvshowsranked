            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Texas, 1983. The personal computer revolution is happening; IBM dominates; a visionary, an engineer, and a prodigy decide to reverse-engineer the IBM PC and build something better. Lee Pace is Joe MacMillan, the salesman with secrets. Scoot McNairy is Gordon Clark, the engineer whose best days might be behind him. Mackenzie Davis is Cameron Howe, the coder who sees what others don't. Four seasons trace the PC era through the internet age: failures, successes, and the cost of being ahead of your time.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The central trio (later quartet with Kerry Bishé) is among television's best: Joe's visionary charisma, Gordon's quiet desperation, Cameron's chaotic brilliance, Donna's hidden strength. The performances develop across seasons—characters become unrecognizable from their first episode, yet the transformation is earned. The chemistry is perfect; the flaws are human.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Silicon Prairie, Texas: the offices, the strip malls, the computer stores. Then Silicon Valley: the garages, the venture capital, the search engines. The tech history is accurate—this is how the industry evolved, from clone PCs to online services to search. Educational without being dry.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Period detail in every frame: the cars, the computers, the hair. The style evolves across decades—the 80s look, the 90s, the early internet age. The aesthetics serve the timeline without being museum exhibits. AMC production values applied to tech history.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people in rooms, arguing about specifications, soldering circuit boards, writing code on green screens. The "spectacle" is ideas—watching a product come together, watching a vision become reality. Intellectual drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Innovation, competition, the cost of genius, the impossibility of staying ahead. The show explores what drives visionary people—Joe's need for his father's approval, Cameron's need to build, Gordon's need to matter. Tech history as character study. Sophisticated and moving.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a product to build: the clone PC, the online service, the antivirus, the search engine. The drive is creation—will they succeed? The personal dynamics provide additional momentum. Some seasons are stronger than others; the cumulative effect is powerful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with perfect ending. The final episode is among television's best: the characters have changed, the industry has changed, the relationships have evolved, and the ending feels inevitable and right. The creators knew where they were going; they arrived beautifully.</p>
