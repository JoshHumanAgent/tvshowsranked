            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Dr. Paul Weston sees patients four days a week. On Fridays, he sees his own therapist. Each episode is a session—real-time, two people in a room, talking. Gabriel Byrne (seasons 1-3) and Uzo Aduba (season 4) are the therapists, listening to patients whose problems unfold across weeks. HBO's Israeli adaptation: chamber drama as television, therapy as performance.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The format requires extraordinary acting: real-time sessions with no escape. Gabriel Byrne's Paul is weary, ethical, professionally compromised. Uzo Aduba's Brooke (season 4) brings different energy. The patients (Dianne Wiest, Josh Charles, Embeth Davidtz, countless others) are each fully realized in weekly visits.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (5/10)</h3>
                <p>There is no world beyond the office: patients talk about their lives, but we only see the therapy. The world is built through dialogue—the patients create their contexts, we imagine the rest. The minimalism is the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Two people in a room: the camera watches, occasionally moves, mostly observes. The style is invisible—the sessions should feel like sessions, not television. The minimalism serves the intensity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. Therapy sessions: talking, listening, silence. The "spectacle" is performance and emotion—watching characters break down, build up, resist, reveal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Therapy itself: transference, resistance, ethics, the therapeutic relationship, whether therapists can help while damaged. Each patient represents different issues—grief, addiction, couples in crisis. The show explores the practice of therapy with unusual rigor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The drive is weekly progress: what will the patient reveal, how will the therapist respond, what happens when the hour is up. The Friday sessions (therapist seeing therapist) reveal Paul's own struggles. The format creates its own momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons, with a decade between seasons 3 and 4. Each season is semi-self-contained; the patients change. The show doesn't build toward finale so much as offer repeated glimpses into the therapeutic process. The format resists traditional resolution.</p>
