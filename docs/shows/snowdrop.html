            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1987 Seoul. A university student finds a wounded young man in her dormitory. She hides him, nurses him, falls in love with him. He's a North Korean spy. She doesn't know. Jung Hae-in and Jisoo (from BLACKPINK) star in the Korean historical romance: democracy protests as backdrop, forbidden love as engine. Tragedy is foreshadowed from the first frame.

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jung Hae-in as Soo-ho: the North Korean agent who didn't choose this life. Jisoo as Young-ro: the student whose heart overcomes her fear. The chemistry carries the tragedy. The supporting cast creates the political context.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1987 South Korea: the democracy protests, the spy networks, the university dormitories, the divided Korea. The world is specific and researched—the political tension is as real as the romance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama production: Seoul's winter rendered beautifully, the dormitory hiding the spy, the protests filling the streets. The style is romantic—the snow, the longing looks, the impending tragedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is emotional: the protests, the confrontation, the inevitable tragedy. This is romance against history—not action, but feeling. The production value serves the emotion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Love across political divides, the individual vs. the state, whether we can escape our origins, democracy's cost. The show explores Korean history through a love story that cannot end well.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The clock is ticking: Soo-ho must escape; Young-ro must hide him; the spies are hunting. The structure is countdown—each episode brings the danger closer. The foreshadowing creates dread.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete. The tragedy is delivered as promised. The ending is devastating but earned. Korean drama at its most affecting.</p>
