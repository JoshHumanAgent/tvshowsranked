<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Angelo Ledda has early-onset Alzheimer's. He's also a hitman with a code—he doesn't kill children. When a job involves a 12-year-old girl, he refuses. Then he forgets he refused. Memory of a Killer adapts the Belgian film series into television: an assassin losing his memory tries to complete one last job while being hunted by police and criminals. The show is memory noir—Ledda writes himself notes, records himself, tries to reconstruct his own motives while forgetting what he learned hours ago. The Alzheimer's is both character and plot device: every scene could be compromised by forgotten information. It's a fresh take on hitman thriller.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3><p>The lead actor plays Ledda with desperation—capable assassin losing the capacity to be an assassin. The detective pursuers are competent antagonists. The criminal employers are threats but not caricatures. The Alzheimer's is portrayed with specificity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (6/10)</h3><p>Belgian criminal underworld: hitmen, handlers, police, victims. The world is functional noir without extensive mythology. The memory device makes every location unreliable.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Noir aesthetic: shadows, rain, urban environments. The memory disorder is visualized through editing—time jumps, repeated shots, confusion. The style serves the premise.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>Assassination sequences, police pursuit, the violence of declining memory. Low-budget noir—action is brief, tension is sustained.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Memory as unreliable narrator. Identity when memory fades. When you can't remember your motives, what defines you? The show uses Alzheimer's philosophically—hitman ethics become meaningless when you can't remember the code.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>The job needs completing. The memory won't cooperate. The police are closing in. Every scene has multiple sources of tension. The Alzheimer's provides ticking clock—the protagonist is losing himself in real-time.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3><p>Complete limited series. The job resolves, the police catch up, Ledda's memory completes its decline. Tragic but inevitable—some endings can't be escaped.</p></div></section>
