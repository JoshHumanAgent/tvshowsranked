<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Aziz Ansari is Dev, an actor in New York. He dates, he acts, he negotiates with his parents. Season 2 has an episode in Italy. Season 3 is about Denise and Alicia. Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang's anthology comedy: identity, relationships, immigrant parents, pasta in Italy.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Aziz Ansari as Dev: a version of himself. His parents play themselves. Lena Waithe as Denise. Naomi Ackie in season 3. The performances are naturalistic comedy.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>New New York, Modena Italy, the immigrant experience. Season 3 shifts to different characters entirely—same world, different perspective.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: "New York, I Love You" and "Thanksgiving" (Waithe's Emmy-winning episode) are visual standouts. The Italian season is beautiful.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is Italy: pasta making, scooter rides. But mostly this is people talking in places.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Immigrant children, dating apps, commitment, queer identity, creative fulfillment. The show explores identity with millennial precision.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3><p>Episodic and thematic. Some episodes are experimental ("New York, I Love You"). The drive is character insight.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>Anthology structure. Dev's story arcs incompletely; season 3 is different characters. The show evolves unpredictably.</p></div></section>
