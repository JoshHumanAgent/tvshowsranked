            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Dr. Andy Brown's wife dies. He moves his family from New York to Everwood, Colorado—a small town where he can practice medicine and connect with his son. Treat Williams is Andy; Gregory Smith is Ephram, the gifted pianist son. Greg Berlanti created the WB's most earnest drama: family, loss, and small-town healing.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Treat Williams as Andy Brown: the neurosurgeon starting over. Gregory Smith as Ephram: the son who lost his mother and resents his father. Emily VanCamp as Amy: the girl Ephram loves. The ensemble creates Everwood's community. The performances are WB sincere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Everwood, Colorado: the small town where everyone knows everyone, the mountains, the Main Street. The world is specific and lived-in—a community that grows across four seasons. The WB perfected the small-town aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>WB network aesthetics: the town, the mountains, the houses photographed for warmth. The style is functional—this is family drama, not visual art. The Colorado settings provide natural beauty.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is family drama: doctors, teenagers, relationships. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching characters confront loss and heal. Earnest television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, father-son relationships, starting over, small-town vs. city values, the meaning of community. The show explores these through character—each episode has a lesson without being preachy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ephram and Amy's relationship, Andy's adjustment, the Abbott family next door. The drive is emotional—watching characters grow and struggle. The structure is episodic with serialized relationships.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with appropriate ending. The relationships resolve; the characters move forward. The WB drama tradition of emotional closure. Complete on its own terms.</p>
