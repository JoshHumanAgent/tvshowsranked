## What It Feels Like to Watch

Borgen is a sophisticated Danish political drama that proves politics can make compelling television without American-style melodrama.

The series centers on Birgitte Nyborg Christensen, who becomes Denmark's first female Prime Minister. What follows is a nuanced exploration of power, compromise, and the personal costs of political ambition.

You watch Borgen and feel the weight of governance. These are real decisions with real consequences. The political maneuvering is sophisticated without being impenetrable. The show respects its audience's intelligence.

The performances are exceptional. Sidse Babett Knudsen is magnificent as Birgitte—complex, determined, sometimes ruthless, often vulnerable. The supporting cast creates a believable political world.

Borgen also works as a character study. How does power change people? What are you willing to sacrifice? These questions drive the narrative.
