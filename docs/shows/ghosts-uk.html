<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Alison inherits a crumbling manor house. She falls out a window, nearly dies, and now can see ghosts. The house is full of them—centuries of previous inhabitants. The creators of Horrible Histories made the warmest comedy about death.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Charlotte Ritchie as Alison: the living person adjusting to ghosts. Kiell Smith-Bynoe as Mike: the husband who can't see them. The ghost ensemble (Mathew Baynton, Simon Farnaby, Martha Howe-Douglas, etc.) creates centuries of characters.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Button House: the manor, the ghosts from different eras, the rules of haunting. The world is built through character—each ghost is their century, their death, their stuckness.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>BBC comedy production: the manor, the ghosts rendered with simple effects. The style is functional—this is character comedy, not visual spectacle.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is people (and ghosts) talking in a house. The "spectacle" is the character work—watching centuries interact.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
<p>Death and what comes after, being stuck, finding meaning in eternity, history as human comedy. The show explores these with warmth and humor.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Alison adjusts to ghosts; the ghosts adjust to her; the house must be saved. The structure is episodic comedy—each episode explores character.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
<p>Five seasons, complete. The finale provides closure—ghosts and living find peace. One of the kindest comedies ever made.</p></div></section>
