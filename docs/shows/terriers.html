            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Ocean Beach, San Diego. Two unlicensed private investigators—one former cop, one recovering addict—taking cases that are too small for real detectives and too personal for them to ignore. Hank and Britt are broke, damaged, loyal to each other, incompetent at everything except stumbling into trouble. The tone shifts from comic to tragic within episodes: a missing dog case reveals a murder, a divorce investigation uncovers corruption. The best show you've never heard of, cancelled too soon.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Donal Logue as Hank is a mess you can't look away from—brilliant detective, terrible at everything else. Michael Raymond-James as Britt is his perfect foil: steadier, younger, equally damaged. Their chemistry is the show's heart. Laura Allen as Hank's ex-wife and Kimberly Quinn as Britt's girlfriend provide necessary grounding. The performances find truth in comedy and tragedy alike.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>San Diego as the opposite of noir: sunshine, beaches, endless sprawl. The world is small—Hank's office is his car, his clients are neighbors, his cases are hyper-local. But within that smallness, the show creates complete community: the bar, the beach, the real estate developments, the petty criminals. Intimate world, fully realized.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Sun-drenched, handheld, functional. The look matches the show's DIY aesthetic—these are guys working without office, without license, without resources. The cinematography serves story without pretension. San Diego provides natural light and natural beauty; the show uses both.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is low-budget television about low-rent detectives. The "action" is stakeouts, confrontations in parking lots, conversations in bars. The spectacle is emotional: watching two men try to be better and mostly fail. Modest but effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Class and failure are the themes. Hank and Britt are unlicensed because Hank lost his badge—he's a detective who can't be a detective. They're always one bad break from homelessness. The show explores American masculinity in decline: men who had promise and lost it, trying to matter anyway. The themes are present but not belabored.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode resolves a case while advancing the season arc—a real estate development that connects to corruption, danger, loss. The show balances procedural satisfaction with serialized momentum. Short season (13 episodes) means no padding. Every episode matters. The drive is constant and rewarding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>One perfect season. The finale is devastating—triumph and tragedy inextricable. Britt makes a choice that defines him; Hank faces his past. The ending is complete and conclusive, even as FX cancelled the show. A finale that honors the story, the characters, and the audience. A model of how to end.</p>
