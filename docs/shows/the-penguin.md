## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Penguin is a crime drama serving as a continuation of Matt Reeves' The Batman. It follows Oswald Cobblepot's rise through Gotham's criminal underworld after the death of Carmine Falcone.

You watch The Penguin and witness Colin Farrell's transformative performance. Under layers of prosthetics, he creates a character that ispathetic, ambitious, dangerous, and strangely sympathetic. This is a man who wants more than anything to matter.

The series is a character study of ambition and corruption. It shows how power changes people—and how those left behind by society claw their way to the top.

The production values are exceptional. Gotham has never looked better. The story balances crime thriller with psychological drama.
