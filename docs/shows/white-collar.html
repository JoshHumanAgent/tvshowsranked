            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A con man and an FBI agent, partnered against white-collar crime. Neal Caffrey is charm personified—suits, fedoras, appreciation for the finer things. Peter Burke is the straight arrow who caught him and now works with him. New York gleams in the background; each episode features art, wine, jewelry, or antiques. It's competence porn with exceptional taste—Catching Fire meets Catch Me If You Can, lighter than air and impossibly watchable.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Matt Bomer as Neal Caffrey is perfectly cast—beautiful, charming, capable of suggesting depths beneath the surface. Tim DeKay as Peter Burke provides the necessary grounding: suburban dad energy with FBI competence. Their partnership is the show's heart. Willie Garson as Mozzie, Neal's conspiracy-theorist friend, provides comic relief. The ensemble is small but effective. This is comfort television with exceptionally likable actors.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Manhattan as playground: galleries, auction houses, private collections, exclusive events. The show creates a consistent world of white-collar crime—the forgeries, the heists, the high-society marks. But the world remains television-clean: no real consequences, no real darkness. This is the USA Network formula, executed with style.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Bright, polished, visually appealing. New York looks the way visitors imagine it—gleaming buildings, elegant parties, rooftop gardens. The style matches the content: light, breezy, attractive. Not distinctive, but competent within its aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is tasteful: beautiful objects, beautiful people, beautiful locations. This isn't action television; it's heist television where the pleasure is in watching competent people do clever things. The spectacle is intellectual—appreciating the con, admiring the style.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show doesn't aspire to depth. It's about puzzles con, trust, redemption—but these themes remain surface-level. The pleasure is in execution: watching Neal solve problems, watching Peter grudgingly respect him. The conceptual framework is comfortable, not challenging.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>This is television as comfort food, and it excels at its purpose. Cases of the week are resolved efficiently; serialized elements (Neal's missing girlfriend, the truth about his past) provide ongoing hooks. Each episode ends satisfactorily while leaving doors open. The drive is gentle but persistent—it pulls you forward without demanding urgency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Six seasons with a proper conclusion. Neal's story ends appropriately—he escapes, he's free, he sends Peter a sign. The final episode ties up threads while leaving room for possibility. Few network shows achieve this kind of closure. The ending respects the characters and the audience.</p>
