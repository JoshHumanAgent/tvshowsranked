            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Neptune, California. Veronica Mars used to be popular; then her best friend was murdered, her father lost his job as sheriff, and she was drugged at a party. Now she's a private investigator, working out of her dad's agency while navigating high school. Kristen Bell created an icon: the teenage detective with trauma, quips, and a vengeance streak. Rob Thomas's show was cancelled, then crowdfunded into a movie, then revived for a final season.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Kristen Bell IS Veronica: the voiceover, the snark, the vulnerability underneath. The supporting cast—Jason Dohring as Logan, Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, Percy Daggs III as Wallace—creates a fully realized world. The guest stars each season add to the mythology. Veronica remains one of TV's great protagonists.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Neptune, California: the wealthy 09ers, the working class, the corruption, the class warfare. The town is specific—the rich get away with everything, the sheriff's department is complicit, Veronica fights for the victims. The world persists across seasons and the movie.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>UPN/CW production values: Veronica's voiceover, the noir lighting, the seaside California aesthetic. The style is functional—snappy dialogue matters more than visual flair. The movie and revival had higher budgets but maintained the aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is a teenage detective: stakeouts, interrogations, evidence boards. The "spectacle" is Veronica's mind—watching her piece together what others miss. Low-budget mystery, high-value writing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Class war, privilege, sexual assault, the failure of institutions, daughter-father relationships. The show tackles serious issues through the mystery format—the rich kids get away with it, Veronica won't let them. The themes deepen across seasons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Season-long mysteries with episodic cases: who killed Lily Kane, who caused the bus crash, who's the serial rapist. The drive is constant—Veronica always has a case, a clue, a lead. The structure invented binge-worthy serialized mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons (2004-2006), a crowdfunded movie (2014), a revival (2019). The revival was controversial—dark, divisive—but the series offers multiple endpoints. The original three seasons are complete; the movie provides closure; the revival adds complexity.</p>
