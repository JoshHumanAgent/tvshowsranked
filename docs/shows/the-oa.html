            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Prairie Johnson returns home after seven years missing. She was blind; now she can see. She gathers five people in an abandoned house and tells them her story: abduction, dimension-hopping, a near-death experience that gave her knowledge. Is she telling the truth? Is she delusional? Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij created television's most ambitious mystery: part sci-fi, part fantasy, part character study, entirely unlike anything else.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Brit Marling as Prairie/OA is the center: mysterious, wounded, possibly unreliable. The five people she gathers (including Jason Isaacs as her abductor, in flashbacks) create a community of skeptics becoming believers. Emory Cohen, Brendan Meyer, Brandon Perea—the ensemble is committed. The performances sell the impossible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Multiple dimensions, near-death experiences, the movements that open doors, the science that sounds like magic. The show builds a complete cosmology: there are other dimensions, some people can travel between them, the method requires sacrifice and belief. The world expands across seasons, each revelation deepening the mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Distinctive visual language: the gold mine where Prairie was held, the suburban houses where she gathers her followers, the dimension-hopping sequences. The style is dreamlike without being obscure. Each dimension has its own visual identity. Beautiful and strange.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The movements are the spectacle: choreographed gestures that supposedly open dimensional doors. The NDE sequences, the dimension-hopping, the prison-like facility. The spectacle is conceptual—watching people perform strange movements and wondering if it matters.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Near-death experience as science and spirituality, the multiverse as belief system, the nature of storytelling itself. The show asks whether stories can be true even when they're impossible, whether faith is justified by outcomes. Dense with meaning, resistant to simple interpretation. Television as puzzle and poem.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode peels back a layer: what happened to Prairie, what is she asking people to believe, what are the movements, what are the dimensions. The second season expands into new territory. The drive comes from needing to understand. Binge television designed for obsession.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after two seasons. The second season ends on a cliffhanger that suggests a third season that will never come. The mystery was designed to continue; the cancellation truncates it. The existing material is brilliant; the lack of resolution is devastating. Incomplete.</p>
