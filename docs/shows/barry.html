            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Barry Berkman is a hitman who discovers acting class. He wants to leave his old life. His handler won't let him. Bill Hader created and stars: the darkness of violence and the absurdity of Hollywood, the impossibility of reinvention.</p>
            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Bill Hader as Barry: the hitman wanting to be good. Henry Winkler as Gene Cousineau: the acting teacher. Stephen Root as Fuches: the handler who won't let go. Sarah Goldberg as Sally: the actress whose ambition matches Barry's. The performances are perfect comedy-drama.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Two worlds: the hitman underworld and the Los Angeles acting scene. The contrast is the comedy: Chechens and agents, murder and monologues. Both worlds are toxic in their ways.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>HBO production: the violence sudden, the comedy uncomfortable, the tone shifts seamless. The style serves the whiplash between killing and comedy.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the violence: quick, brutal, punctuating the comedy. The "spectacle" is the tonal shift—from acting class to murder in seconds.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Reinvention, whether we can escape our pasts, what we owe to others vs. ourselves, the toxicity of Hollywood, the impossibility of goodness for some. The show explores these through tragicomedy.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Barry wants out. Fuches pulls him back. The acting class offers another life. The structure is escape attempt—the drive is whether reinvention is possible.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Four seasons with definitive ending. The finale is debated—some found it appropriate, others bleak. But the story concludes. Barry's fate is sealed. Complete.</p></div>
