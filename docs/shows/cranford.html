            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Cranford is a small English village in the 1840s, run by women. The men are away or insignificant; the women manage society through strict social codes and quiet kindness. Elizabeth Gaskell's novel adapted by Heidi Thomas: Judi Dench, Imelda Staunton, Eileen Atkins, and a cast of Britain's finest. Domestic drama without melodrama—small events rendered significant by the precision of observation.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Judi Dench, Imelda Staunton, Eileen Atkins—the finest actors of their generation playing women navigating a changing world. The ensemble is perfect: each character distinct, each relationship specific. Michael Gambon, Francesca Annis, Philip Glenister in support. Acting at the highest level.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>1840s Cheshire: the village, the houses, the social hierarchy, the codes of behavior. The world is specific and complete—this is how these people lived, what they valued, what they feared. The railway is coming; Cranford will never be the same. The world is preserved in amber.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC period drama at its finest: candlelit rooms, village streets, costumes that signify status. The style is observational rather than showy—the camera watches these women live their lives. Beautiful without being ostentatious.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the village, the costumes, the social rituals. This is domestic drama—the "spectacle" is the detail of daily life. The production value is high; the ambitions are intimate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Change, tradition, female autonomy, community, the meaning of small events. The show explores how a community adapts to the world changing around it. The railway represents modernity; the women represent continuity. Profound without being loud.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic events: a visit, a death, a financial crisis, a wedding. The drive is gentle—this is daily life, not thriller. The momentum accumulates as the railway approaches. Patient viewers rewarded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries (plus Christmas special). The railway arrives; Cranford adapts; the characters find their resolutions. The ending is perfect—change acknowledged, continuity preserved. A complete statement.</p>
