## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Pacific is a companion to Band of Brothers, and it carries the weight of that legacy with both pride and its own identity. If Band of Brothers was about brotherhood, The Pacific is about the brutality of war itself.

The series follows U.S. Marines in the Pacific Theater during World War II—Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. The battles are shown with unflinching honesty. This is not glorious combat; it's mud, blood, fear, and death.

The characters are different from Band of Brothers' Easy Company. Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie are the emotional centers—young men who go to war and come back forever changed. The psychological toll is the real subject of the series.

You watch The Pacific and feel exhausted. That's the point. The series wants you to understand what these men endured.
