            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Detroit. A cop framed for corruption returns to clear his name. A detective struggles with his brother's criminal life. A mobster struggles with his conscience. Paul Haggis created a network crime drama that was too dark, too complex, too good for 1996 television. Ken Olin, Joe Pantoliano, Jason Gedrick lead an ensemble in a show that predicted The Wire's moral complexity. Cancelled after 9 episodes, but those episodes are treasure.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Ken Olin as Cameron Quinn is the cop with a past. Joe Pantoliano as Jimmy Murtha is the mobster you might root for. Jason Gedrick, John Spencer, Deborah Farentino—the ensemble plays moral ambiguity with commitment. The performances are ahead of their time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Detroit crime: the streets, the police department, the mob families. The world is noir-drenched—no one is clean, every institution is compromised. The city is rendered as character, economic decline meeting organized crime.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Network TV 1996, but with ambition: shadows, rain, urban decay photographed like film noir. The style suggests more than the budget allowed. The mood is thick; the look is distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. 1996 network TV crime drama budget. The "spectacle" is moral—watching characters choose between bad options. This is character drama, not action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Corruption as system, loyalty vs. law, whether good people can survive in bad institutions. The show explores the gray areas network TV avoided in 1996. The themes are The Wire-adjacent, a decade early.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Serialized crime drama: Quinn wants his name cleared, the mob has internal conflicts, the detective watches his brother. The 9 episodes build momentum. The cancellation interrupted what could have been great.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (3/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after 9 episodes. The story is incomplete; the arcs are cut short. What exists is excellent; what's missing is tragic. A victim of being too good for its time.</p>
