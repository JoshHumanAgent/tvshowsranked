            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Stars Hollow, Connecticut. Lorelai Gilmore had a baby at 16; now she and her daughter Rory are best friends navigating life, love, and Friday night dinners with Lorelai's wealthy parents. Amy Sherman-Palladino created television's most dialogue-dense show: rapid-fire references, fast-talking intimacy, mother-daughter as peers. The comfort show that's also about class, ambition, and the family you make.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Lauren Graham as Lorelai created an icon: the fast talk, the pop culture references, the damage under the charm. Alexis Bledel as Rory grew from teenager to adult across seven seasons. Kelly Bishop and Edward Herrmann as the parents bring weight to the comedy. The town of Stars Hollow (Melissa McCarthy, Sean Gunn, Liza Weil) is one of TV's great ensembles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Stars Hollow is complete: the diner, the inn, the gazebo, the town meetings, the festivals. The world is specific and consistent—every character has history, every location has memory. The show creates a place you want to visit and characters you want to know.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Network TV aesthetics: bright, functional, the style of early 2000s dramedy. The visual language serves the dialogue without distinguishing. The revival (A Year in the Life) had higher production values but similar approach.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. Small town, diners, houses. The "spectacle" is the dialogue—watching characters talk faster than seems possible. This is word-dense television, not visual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Class and money, mother-daughter relationships, ambition vs. contentment, the family you're born into vs. the family you make. The show explores privilege through the Gilmores' wealth and Lorelai's rejection of it. The lightness masks depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic with serialized development: Rory's education, Lorelai's relationships, the Friday night dinners. The drive is life—growing up, falling in love, making mistakes. The pace is fast (the dialogue) and slow (the years passing).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Seven seasons, then a revival nine years later. The original ending (without Sherman-Palladino) was controversial; the revival provided closure—some of it devastating. The show exists in two forms: the complete original and the revival that recontextualizes.</p>
