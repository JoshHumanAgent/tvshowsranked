            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A child disappears on vacation in France. The father sees him slip away; the mother was swimming; the hotel pool was crowded. Years pass. The marriage collapses. And then—a sighting. A photograph. Maybe. Harry and Jack Williams created anthology television about the disappeared: each season a different case, each exploring what absence does to parents. James Nesbitt (season 1) and David Morrissey (season 2) are men destroyed by not knowing.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>James Nesbitt in season 1 is devastating—a father whose obsession destroys what remains of his life. Tchéky Karyo as the French detective provides moral center across seasons. David Morrissey and Keeley Hawes in season 2 explore different damage. The performances are raw, emotionally precise. The child's absence is felt in the parents' disintegration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1: France and Britain, the expatriate community, the police investigation, the media circus. Season 2: Germany, the military, the girl who returns but isn't who she claims. The worlds are distinct but connected by the experience of loss. The production design creates specific places—vacation towns, hospitals, interrogation rooms—rendered with authenticity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two timelines, intercut: the disappearance and the years after. The visual distinction between past (brighter, hopeful) and present (desaturated, damaged) creates emotional contrast without confusion. The camera stays close on faces, following the actors' internal journeys. Effective, unsparing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is the horror of absence: a father waiting for news that never comes, a detective hunting for a child who might be dead, a mother trying to hold on to hope. The spectacle is parental grief, rendered without exploitation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, hope, the destructiveness of not knowing. The show explores how parents continue when the worst has happened but might not be final. The missing exist in limbo—neither alive nor confirmed dead. The psychological territory is specific and devastating. Not easy viewing, but essential.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season is eight episodes of mounting tension. Is he alive? Is she who she claims? The Williams brothers structure mysteries like puzzles—clues planted, timelines interleaved, revelations earned. The drive is intense. Each episode ends with a complication. Not for binge-watching; the tension requires processing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season resolves the central mystery—but resolution doesn't mean happy ending. Season 1's conclusion answers the question but devastates. Season 2's resolution is similarly complete. Anthology format allows each story proper ending. Television that respects its material.</p>
