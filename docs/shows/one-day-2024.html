            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Emma and Dexter meet on graduation night, July 15, 1988. They almost have a one-night stand; instead, they become friends. Each episode is one day—July 15—across twenty-three years. Ambika Mod is Emma: working-class, ambitious, waiting. Leo Woodall is Dexter: posh, driftless, charmed. David Nicholls' novel adapted into the definitive version: love over decades, timing over fate, will they/won't they as life rather than plot.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Ambika Mod captures Emma's intelligence, insecurity, and slow self-acceptance. Leo Woodall's Dexter transforms from irritating to tragic across episodes. The chemistry is real—the friendship, the near-misses, the frustration. Supporting cast appears briefly; the show belongs to its leads.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Britain across decades: 1988 graduation, 1990s London, 2000s Paris, the progression of careers, relationships, aging. The world is accurate—each July 15 is a snapshot of where they are now. The structure creates world through accumulation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production with period accuracy: the clothes, the hair, the London flats. The style is romantic but not glossy—this is love with bills and bad jobs and compromise. The visual language supports the emotional truth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people talking, drinking coffee, working jobs, having near-misses. The spectacle is emotional—the devastation of the ending, the accumulation of years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Love and timing, friendship vs. romance, the roads not taken, whether "someday" ever arrives. The show asks what happens when you find the right person at the wrong time. The structure—one day per year—makes every moment weighty. The themes are classical but rendered fresh.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode jumps forward a year; each July 15 reveals new developments. The drive is accumulation: where are they now, have they gotten closer or further, will this be the year? The structure creates intense binge momentum despite the lack of traditional plot tension.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete adaptation. The novel's ending is preserved—devastating, controversial, perfect. All fourteen episodes build to a conclusion that breaks viewers. The show is better than the 2011 film; the structure is served; the ending is earned.</p>
