## What It Feels Like to Watch

Pablo Escobar was one of the most dangerous men in history: a Colombian drug lord who built a billion-dollar empire, bought off politicians, and declared war on his own government. *Narcos* tells his story — and it's unlike anything else on television.

The show is Colombian-American co-production, filmed on location in Colombia, and it doesn't shy away from the violence and corruption of the drug trade. Wagner Moura is extraordinary as Escobar — charismatic, brutal, and strangely sympathetic. He's a family man, a terrorist, a philanthropist, and a murderer, and the show captures all these contradictions.

TheDEA agents — particularly Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook) and Javier Peña (Pedro Pascal) — provide the American perspective, but the show is smartest when it's focused on the Colombian characters: the police, the politicians, the paramilitaries, the victims.

The first two seasons focus on Escobar and are exceptional. The third season shifts to the Cali Cartel and loses some momentum, but it's still compelling television.

This is prestige crime drama that doesn't romanticize the drug trade — it shows the cost, the violence, and the endless cycle of supply and demand.
