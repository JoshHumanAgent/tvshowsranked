## What It Feels Like to Watch

Succession is a show about terrible people with obscene amounts of money, and you'll love watching them destroy each other.

At the center is Logan Roy (Brian Cox), the aging patriarch of a global media empire. He's dying—he knows it, his children know it, everyone knows it. And in the vacuum created by his decline, his four children—Kendall, Siobhan, Roman, and Connor—circle like sharks, each convinced they're the one who should inherit the throne.

The genius of Succession is how it makes you care about people you shouldn't. They're cruel, entitled, and out of touch. But underneath the arrogance, you see the wounds Logan inflicted. You see the desperate need for parental approval that will never come. You see people trying to fill a void that can never be filled.

Brian Cox is extraordinary as Logan—a monster who occasionally shows vulnerability, a father who destroys his children while claiming to love them. Jeremy Strong as Kendall is the heart of the series, a man desperately trying to prove himself while visibly drowning. Kieran Culkin as Roman is the jester who hides pain with jokes. Sarah Snook as Shiv is the strategist who thinks she's playing chess while everyone else plays poker.

The writing is razor-sharp. Every scene crackles with tension. Every episode ends with a reversal. The dialogue is quotable—everyone has a favorite line, a favorite insult, a favorite moment of pure cruelty.

But what elevates Succession beyond mere satire is its emotional core. Beneath the comedy and the backstabbing is a genuine exploration of family dysfunction, of what wealth does to people, of the hollowness at the center of power. The final season is devastating—not because of what happens, but because of what it means.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 1.90**

**Strengths:**
- **Logan Roy (Brian Cox)**: A towering achievement. Cox plays the media mogul as an apocalyptic figure—part tyrant, part tragic patriarch. His "terrible person" speech is legendary, but it's the quieter moments (his vulnerability in the finale, his manipulation of each child) that define him. Cox brings Shakespearean gravitas to what could have been a cartoon villain.
- **Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong)**: The emotional core of the series. Strong's performance is a masterclass in fragility and ambition. His "Kendall Roy is the guy" press conference, his breakdown at his father's birthday, his final act of desperation—Strong makes you feel every wound. He's the tragic hero who can never escape his father's shadow.
- **Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin)**: A revelation. Culkin hides pain behind jokes, and his arc—from comic relief to grieving son to CEO candidate—is devastating. His "boar on the floor" breakdown is the show's most raw moment. Culkin finds humanity in the least likely character.
- **Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook)**: The smartest person in the room who can't stop self-sabotaging. Snook plays Shiv with razor-sharp intelligence and deep vulnerability. Her final choice—choosing power over family—is heartbreaking in its inevitability.
- **Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen)**: The ultimate climber. Macfadyen makes Tom both pathetic and threatening. His "Greg is my friend" spiral and his transformation from outsider to predator is compelling.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Connor Roy (Alan Ruck)**: While Alan Ruck does excellent work, Connor often feels like he's in a different show—more absurdist comedy than family drama.
- **Supporting players sometimes flatten**: Characters like Gerri, Frank, and Karl exist primarily as功能性 players, though the actors elevate them.

**Why 9.5 and not 10**: Just misses the absolute peak. The supporting cast, while excellent, doesn't reach the depth of The Wire's ensemble. Some characters (particularly Connor) feel slightly underutilized.

---

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 1.35**

**Strengths:**
- **Waystar Royco as empire**: The media conglomerate feels massive and real. From news divisions to theme parks to cruises, Waystar is a complete world. The ATN news network's political influence is terrifyingly believable.
- **Corporate culture**: The show understands how power operates in high places. Board meetings, shareholder votes, hostile takeovers—all depicted with insider knowledge.
- **The birthday as battlefield**: The show uses recurring events (birthdays, weddings, funerals, holidays) as set pieces where family tensions explode.
- **Geographic scope**: From New York to England to Hungary to Norway—the show travels, and each location feels purposeful.
- **The media empire**: ATN, Pierce Media, GoJo—the consolidation of power is depicted as both mundane and terrifying.

**Weaknesses:**
- **The cruises subplot**: While important to the plot, it feels slightly manufactured as a crisis.
- **Not as expansive as The Wire**: The world of Succession is impressive but more contained than Baltimore's streets.

**Why 9.0**: A brilliant depiction of elite power structures, though not quite as all-encompassing as The Wire's world.

---

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 0.90**

**Strengths:**
- **Tracking shots**: The show uses long takes to follow characters through hallways, parties, and offices. The family gathering in the finale is a technical marvel.
- **Framing**: Characters are often positioned in doorways, windows, or at the edges of frames—emphasizing their isolation even in crowded rooms.
- **Party scenes**: The weddings, birthdays, and corporate events are shot with chaotic energy that captures dysfunction perfectly.
- **Light and shadow**: The lighting in key moments (Logan's final scene, Shiv's wedding) is deliberate and expressive.
- **The finale's single shot**: The continuous take following Kendall through the party is breathtaking filmmaking.

**Weaknesses:**
- Not as visually distinctive as Chernobyl or Hannibal.
- Some episodes are more workmanlike than inspired.

**Why 9.0**: Consistently excellent, with moments of true visual brilliance, though not groundbreaking.

---

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 0.85**

**Strengths:**
- **Corporate battles**: The shareholder meeting, the GoJo deal, the hostile takeover attempts—all provide spectacle.
- **Weddings and funerals**: The season 4 wedding is a masterpiece of gathering everyone in one place.
- **The Vaulter shutdown**: The brutal corporate violence is visually stark.
- **Physical comedy**: Roman's "boar on the floor" scene is spectacular in its chaos.
- **The finale's finale**: The final episode delivers on spectacle—the last press conference, the final family meeting.

**Weaknesses:**
- Not a show of grand set pieces or action sequences.
- The spectacle is primarily human rather than cinematic.

**Why 8.5**: The spectacle is in the human drama, not explosions—but when the show delivers, it delivers.

---

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 1.35**

**Strengths:**
- **Wealth as corruption**: The show explores how obscene money hollows out people. None of the Roys know how to love, to connect, to be content.
- **Succession as theme**: What happens when the king dies? The show examines power transfer within families.
- **Media and truth**: ATN's manipulation of news is a terrifying commentary on information control.
- **Meritocracy myth**: The show deconstructs the idea that anyone "deserves" their position.
- **Sibling bonds**: The complex love/hate relationships between the siblings—complicated by shared trauma and shared privilege.
- **The American Dream**: The Roys have everything and want more. The show asks: what's the point?

**Weaknesses:**
- Some philosophical moments feel slightly too on-the-nose.
- The show sometimes prioritizes cleverness over depth.

**Why 9.0**: Dense with themes of family, power, and wealth, though not quite as intellectually ambitious as The Wire.

---

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 1.425**

**Strengths:**
- **Episode endings**: Nearly every episode ends with a reversal. The "confirmation hearing," the bear hug, the birthday speech—you have to keep watching.
- **Season-long arcs**: Each season builds to a climax that redefines everything. The season 2 finale ("This Is Not for Tears") is extraordinary.
- **Escalation engine**: Each season raises the stakes—from internal family struggle to controlling the company to global media dominance.
- **Tension mastery**: The season 3 finale's "kill list" reveal, the season 4's election—these build to unbearable tension.
- **Binge-worthy structure**: The show rewards continuous viewing. Each episode advances the story meaningfully.

**Weaknesses:**
- Season 1 is slower than the others as the show finds its footing.
- Some mid-season episodes feel like setup.

**Why 9.5**: Nearly flawless momentum. The show never lets up and each episode delivers.

---

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 1.35**

**Strengths:**
- **Series finale "With Open Eyes"**: A devastating conclusion. Kendall's final press conference is heartbreaking. The show refuses easy answers.
- **Earned ending**: Every character's ending feels inevitable. Shiv at the table, Kendall in the car, Roman with his grief.
- **No happy endings**: The finale is honest about what these people are and what they'll become.
- **Thematic closure**: The show ends with the same question it began—who will control Waystar?—and answers it honestly.

**Weaknesses:**
- Some fans wanted more explicit resolution of certain plot threads.
- The ending is deliberately ambiguous about whether Kendall survives.

**Why 9.0**: A bold, devastating conclusion that fits the show's themes, though slightly less satisfying than Breaking Bad's finale.

## Why It Ranks #1

Succession earns its #1 ranking because it combines the best elements of television: extraordinary performances, razor-sharp writing, and emotional depth beneath surface-level satire. It's a show about terrible people that somehow makes you care about them—and then devastates you when they destroy themselves.

The characters—Logan, Kendall, Shiv, Roman—are among the most complex in television history. Brian Cox's Logan is a monster, but Cox finds the tragedy in the tyrant. Jeremy Strong's Kendall is the heart of the show—a man who can never escape his father's shadow. The show understands that wealth doesn't solve problems; it creates new ones.

The narrative drive is relentless. Each episode ends with a reversal. Each season escalates. And the finale is devastating—not because of what happens, but because of what it reveals about these people.

Succession is television at its finest: entertaining, intelligent, and emotionally devastating.
