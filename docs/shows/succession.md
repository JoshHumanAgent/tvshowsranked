## What It Feels Like to Watch

Succession is a show about terrible people with obscene amounts of money, and you'll love watching them destroy each other.

At the center is Logan Roy (Brian Cox), the aging patriarch of a global media empire. He's dying—he knows it, his children know it, everyone knows it. And in the vacuum created by his decline, his four children—Kendall, Siobhan, Roman, and Connor—circle like sharks, each convinced they're the one who should inherit the throne.

The genius of Succession is how it makes you care about people you shouldn't. They're cruel, entitled, and out of touch. But underneath the arrogance, you see the wounds Logan inflicted. You see the desperate need for parental approval that will never come. You see people trying to fill a void that can never be filled.

Brian Cox is extraordinary as Logan—a monster who occasionally shows vulnerability, a father who destroys his children while claiming to love them. Jeremy Strong as Kendall is the heart of the series, a man desperately trying to prove himself while visibly drowning. Kieran Culkin as Roman is the jester who hides pain with jokes. Sarah Snook as Shiv is the strategist who thinks she's playing chess while everyone else plays poker.

The writing is razor-sharp. Every scene crackles with tension. Every episode ends with a reversal. The dialogue is quotable—everyone has a favorite line, a favorite insult, a favorite moment of pure cruelty.

But what elevates Succession beyond mere satire is its emotional core. Beneath the comedy and the backstabbing is a genuine exploration of family dysfunction, of what wealth does to people, of the hollowness at the center of power. The final season is devastating—not because of what happens, but because of what it means.
