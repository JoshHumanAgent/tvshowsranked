## What It Feels Like to Watch

Patrick Melrose has everything a man could want — money, education, connections — and none of it helps. He's an addict, drowning in heroin and alcohol, running from a childhood so traumatic he can barely acknowledge it. Each episode of this miniseries follows him through a different crisis, each one revealing more of the damage done by his monstrous father.

Benedict Cumberbatch gives a career-best performance as Patrick — all jagged edges and desperate charm. He plays the character's addiction as both defense and disease, a way to survive the un-survivable. You watch him destroy relationships, humiliate himself, and somehow keep going, and you understand exactly why.

The show is based on novels by Edward St Aubyn, and it captures the specific cruelty of the British upper class — the way privilege becomes prison, the way family becomes trap. Patrick's parents (played by Hugo Weaving and Jennifer Jason Leigh) are chilling in their casual sadism. They destroy their son without ever quite meaning to.

The five episodes are each set in different time periods, jumping between Patrick's childhood and his adulthood. The structure keeps you off-balance — just as Patrick is beginning to function, we flash back to what broke him. The effect is cumulative and devastating.

This is not an easy watch. It depicts addiction, abuse, and the long aftermath of both without sentimentality. But it's also strangely hopeful — a story about survival, about learning to live with damage that can't be undone.

The final episode, "At Last," offers no fairy-tale redemption. Just a man learning to be present in his own life, moment by moment, without the buffer of drugs.
