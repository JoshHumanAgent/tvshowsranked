            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Dwight Manfredi finishes 25 years in prison. The Mafia gives him Tulsa, Oklahoma as territory. He builds a crew from misfits. Sylvester Stallone is Dwight: old-school mobster in new-world America. Taylor Sheridan creates a fish-out-of-water crime dramedy: Goodfellas meets Tulsa.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Sylvester Stallone as Dwight: the aging gangster, out of time but sharp. The supporting cast creates his Tulsa crew—locals who become his soldiers. Stallone embraces the comedy and the threat.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Tulsa, Oklahoma: not traditional Mafia territory. The world is Dwight's operation expanding into unfamiliar terrain. The contrast between New York mob and Oklahoma is the premise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Paramount+ production: Tulsa rendered with Western aesthetics, the criminal operations staged with Sheridan-style. The style is modern Western crime.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is criminal operation: shakedowns, negotiations, turf establishment. Less violent than traditional mob shows; more comedy. The spectacle is fish-out-of-water.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Old world vs. new world, whether the old codes still apply, starting over late in life, loyalty in modern America. The show explores these through Dwight's Tulsa adventure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Dwight builds his operation, navigates Tulsa, deals with the New York mob's expectations. The structure is empire-building with criminal comedy. The drive is establishment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Two seasons completed. The operation continues to build. No announced endpoint—Taylor Sheridan shows tend to run until they stop.</p>
