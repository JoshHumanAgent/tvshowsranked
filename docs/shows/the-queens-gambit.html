<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Beth Harmon is an orphan who discovers chess. She's also a prodigy with addiction. Anya Taylor-Joy is Beth: the intensity, the loneliness, the brilliance. Scott Frank adapts Walter Tevis: 1960s chess, pills, and one woman's rise to the top.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Anya Taylor-Joy as Beth: the eyes that see the board, the loneliness, the addiction. The supporting cast (Moses Ingram, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Bill Camp) creates the chess world. Taylor-Joy makes genius visible.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>1960s chess: the tournaments, the orphanage, the basement games, the Soviets. The world is the chess subculture rendered with detail. Beth is the prodigy entering a man's world.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: 1960s design, chess made cinematic, Beth's visions on the ceiling. The style makes the cerebral visible. The period detail is perfect.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is chess: tournaments, travel, the 1960s design. The visual pleasure is in the production—every frame is composed. Not action, but beauty.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Genius and isolation, addiction as self-medication, women in men's worlds, found family, what genius costs. The show explores these through Beth's journey.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Beth rises: tournament to tournament, pill to pill, loss to victory. The structure is sports movie—the drive is championship. Each episode is escalation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The Russian tournament is the climax. The ending is perfect—Beth triumphant, changed, choosing her path. Essential viewing.</p></div></section>
