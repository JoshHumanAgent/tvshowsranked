            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Vinnie and his friends live in a small Lancashire town. They steal, they scheme, they survive. It's not glamorous, but it's theirs. Joe Gilgun created and stars in the show based on his own experiences. Northern working-class life as comedy: the schemes are absurd, the friendship is real.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Joe Gilgun as Vinnie: the chaotic leader, the mental health struggles, the loyalty. Michelle Keegan as Erin: the girlfriend trying to escape. The ensemble creates the friend group with specificity. The performances are genuine Northern working-class.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Hawley, Lancashire: the council estate, the pubs, the schemes, the limited options. The world is specific to Northern working-class Britain. The details are authentic—the show is created by someone who lived it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Sky comedy production: the Lancashire town rendered with rough beauty, the schemes filmed for comedy. The style is functional—the setting and characters carry it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is working-class life: the schemes are small, the stakes are personal. The "spectacle" is the absurdity of the schemes and the loyalty of friendship. Comedy from lived experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Working-class survival, mental health, friendship as family, escaping vs. belonging, what options exist in places with no opportunities. The show explores these through comedy, not tragedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode has a scheme. The serialized element is character: Vinnie's mental health, Erin's escape attempts, the friend group's dynamics. The structure is episodic comedy with heart.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Six seasons and continuing. The friend group evolves; some characters leave; life continues. The show maintains quality. No endpoint yet.</p>
