            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A fictional Korea where mages can shift souls between bodies. An assassin trapped in a weak body is rescued by a nobleman who doesn't know her secret. They fall in love; their pasts complicate everything. The Hong sisters (writers) combine historical fantasy, body-swap romance, and political intrigue into something fresh. K-drama at its most inventive: magic, romance, comedy, tragedy, and action in one package.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Lee Jae-wook as Jang Uk, the nobleman whose destiny is entangled with magic; Jung So-min as the soul-shifter whose body isn't her own. The chemistry between them drives the first season. Go Yoon-jung takes over for season 2 (plot-relevant), maintaining quality. The supporting cast provides comedy, villainy, and texture. K-drama acting at its best.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Daeho, a fictional kingdom with a complete magic system: soul shifters, elemental magic, the ice stone, the alchemy of souls. The rules are detailed—shifting has costs, forbidden magic has consequences. The world expands across seasons: family histories, political factions, ancient conflicts. World-building as foundation for story.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama production values: elaborate costumes, CGI magic, stunning locations. The action sequences are staged with clarity and impact. The romantic scenes are photographed for maximum beauty. The visual language distinguishes this from historical dramas without magic. Feast for the eyes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is constant: magic battles, soul-shifting sequences, aerial combat, ice magic. The budget is visible on screen—this is feature-quality fantasy on television. The spectacle serves story rather than overwhelming it. Impressive throughout.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Fate vs. choice, identity across bodies, the cost of forbidden magic. The soul-shifting concept raises questions: if your body changes, are you still you? The politics of magical lineages provides additional layers. Entertaining first, philosophical second—but both present.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Thirty episodes across two seasons. The first season builds the world, the romance, the conflict; the second resolves the consequences. Each episode advances multiple threads—romance, politics, magic. The pace is K-doma standard: steady momentum with climactic peaks. Binge-worthy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete story. The two seasons form a single arc: love, loss, reunion, resolution. The ending satisfies—fate is challenged, love persists, consequences are paid. K-drama at its most complete. Excellent conclusion.</p>
