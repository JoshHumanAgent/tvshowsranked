            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A body is found on the bridge between El Paso and Juárez—half in Texas, half in Mexico. Two detectives, one from each side, must work together. Sonya Cross (Diane Kruger) has Asperger's; Marco Ruiz (Demián Bichir) is charming but compromised. The killer targets those who exploit the border. Adaptation of the Danish/Swedish original, transplanted to the US-Mexico border. The landscape is different; the darkness is the same.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Diane Kruger's Sonya is distinct: the Asperger's portrayed without cliché, the detective work, the social difficulties. Demián Bichir's Marco is the wounded man—corrupt but trying, charming but failing. The supporting cast (Ted Levine, Annabeth Gish, Matthew Lillard) creates the border world. The performances match the darkness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The US-Mexico border: El Paso and Juárez, two cities sharing a river and a body count. The world is specific—the cartels, the maquiladoras, the immigration enforcement. The border itself is central: it divides and connects. The world is built with journalistic attention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Desert noir: the bridge, the border, the desert, the two cities. The photography captures the landscape as character. The violence is shown with restraint; the atmosphere is shown with detail. FX production values applied to border thriller.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the border itself: the bridge, the fence, the checkpoint. The violence is present but not gratuitous. This is psychological thriller, not action. The landscape provides the visual interest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The border as metaphor and reality: immigration, exploitation, the drug trade, the people caught between nations. The killer targets those who benefit from border suffering. The show explores the American side and the Mexican side with equal facility.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 follows the serial killer investigation; season 2 expands to cartel intrigue. The pacing is deliberate—this is slow-burn thriller, not procedural. The mystery unfolds through character as much as plot. The second season is weaker than the first.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled after two seasons. The first season's mystery resolves; the second season's cartel storyline is incomplete. The show was building toward something larger; we got the first act and half of the second.</p>
