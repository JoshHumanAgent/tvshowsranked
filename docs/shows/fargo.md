## What It Feels Like to Watch

Fargo takes the Coen Brothers' 1996 film and transforms it into an anthology series—each season a new story, a new crime, a new cast of weirdos in the frozen upper Midwest. It's proof that you can adapt a beloved film without destroying it.

The first season is extraordinary. Martin Freeman plays a insurance salesman whose life unravels when he hires a mysterious hitman. Billy Bob Thornton is mesmerizing as Lorne Malvo—a man of terrifying charm. The story builds to something darkly comic and deeply moving.

The second season is equally brilliant. Kirsten Dunst and Patrick Wilson play a married couple whose lives intersect with a crime family. Bokeem Woodbine as Mike Milligan is a revelation—a young gangster who quotes Shakespeare and delivers mail.

Each season stands alone. The third explores power and violence in 1978. The fourth is about competing crime families in 1950. The fifth returns to the present with a story about mother-daughter crime lords.

What unites them is the tone—dark comedy meeting crime thriller, with the frozen landscape as backdrop. The Coens' influence is everywhere, but Noah Hawley makes it his own.
