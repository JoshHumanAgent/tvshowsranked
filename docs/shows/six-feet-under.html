            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>Six Feet Under is about a family that runs a funeral home, which means it's about death every week. But it's really about life—how we avoid it, how we face it, how we pretend it won't happen to us. Each episode opens with a death: some random, some expected, some absurd. Then we follow the.body to Fisher & Sons, where the Fisher family will prepare it while their own lives fall apart.</p>
            <p>Nate Fisher (Peter Krause) returns home when his father dies, planning to leave but getting pulled back into the family business. David (Michael C. Hall) is the closeted gay son who stayed, running the funeral home with rigid precision. Claire (Lauren Ambrose) is the artistic youngest child, lost and angry. Ruth (Frances Conroy) is their mother, widowed and suddenly free, trying to figure out who she is after decades of being a wife.</p>
            <p>The show is funny in ways HBO hadn't been before. It's dark comedy—conversations with corpses, hallucinated debates with dead fathers, funeral mishaps—but it's also deeply sad. These are people who can't connect, who want to be known and are terrified of being known. Nate runs from commitment. David runs from himself. Claire runs from everything. Ruth doesn't know how to run, so she just hurts.</p>
            <p>The series finale is often cited as the best in television history. "Everyone's Waiting" shows each character's death—not in a flash-forward, but in a montage that plays as Sia's "Breathe Me" builds. We see how they die, when they die, and we understand that death is not tragedy but completion. The show that began every episode with a death ends by showing us everyone's death, and it feels like a gift.</p>
            <p>This is a show about acceptance. Accepting mortality. Accepting family. Accepting yourself. It's also about funeral directing, embalming, grief counseling, and the business of death. The Fishers are good at their jobs because they can't manage their own lives—but they're learning.</p>
