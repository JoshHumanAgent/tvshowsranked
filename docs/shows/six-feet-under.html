            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The Fisher family runs a funeral home in Los Angeles. Nathaniel Fisher dies; his sons Nate and David must run the business. Each episode begins with a death—the client they'll serve. Alan Ball created television's most honest show about mortality: the family, the business, the grief, the life that continues. The finale is legendary.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Peter Krause as Nate, Michael C. Hall as David, Frances Conroy as Ruth, Lauren Ambrose as Claire—the Fisher family is among television's most real. The supporting cast (Rachel Griffiths, Mathew St. Patrick, Jeremy Sisto) creates a community. The performances are HBO-quality: raw, committed, specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Fisher & Sons funeral home: the residence above, the embalming room below, the family dynamics everywhere. The world is specific to place and profession. Death is the business; life is the complication.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production early 2000s: functional, observational, the funeral home as character. The style serves the intimacy. The death sequences at the start of each episode are distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is death and family: bodies, grief, arguments, love. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching people confront mortality. The most unspectacular spectacular show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Death, grief, family, sexuality, mental health, purpose, what we leave behind. The show explores mortality without sentimentality. Each death is a meditation; each episode is philosophy through character. Among television's most thoughtful shows.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode has a death and a funeral; the serialized arcs follow the family. Nate's relationships, David's sexuality, Ruth's late-life reinvention, Claire's art. The drive is life—messy, complicated, continuing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with the greatest finale in television history. The last ten minutes show every character's death—what happens to them, when, how. The ending is devastating and beautiful. Complete and perfect.</p>
