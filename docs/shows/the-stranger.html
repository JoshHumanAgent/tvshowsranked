            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A stranger approaches a man at his child's soccer game and whispers a secret: his wife faked a pregnancy two years ago. This is how it begins—a stranger with secrets, revealing them to people who thought they knew their lives. Harlan Coben's novel adapted into British thriller: suburbs full of lies, families built on deceptions, the past demanding payment. Richard Armitage is the husband whose world cracks; Hannah John-Kamen is the stranger with her own agenda. Everyone has something to hide.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Richard Armitage as the husband whose wife disappears brings appropriate desperation. Hannah John-Kamen as the stranger is enigmatic without being blank. Siobhan Finneran as the detective and Jennifer Saunders as a supporting character add weight. The performances are solid genre work; no one embarrasses, no one transcends.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Suburban England as thriller setting: soccer fields, community centers, middle-class homes hiding middle-class secrets. The world is functional; the secrets are the point. Coben's universe overlaps with other adaptations—the setting is credible but not distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Thriller competence: shadows, suspicious glances, rain on windshields. The style is indistinguishable from other Netflix British thrillers. Functional, effective, forgettable. The mystery is told clearly; the atmosphere is present without being memorable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is secrets revealed through conversation: a photo, a document, a confession. The drama is entirely domestic and interpersonal. The "spectacle" is the collapse of certainty.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The cost of secrets, the impossibility of truly knowing anyone, suburban facades hiding suburban sins. The themes are present but secondary to the plot machinery. This is thriller as puzzle, not thriller as examination. Entertaining without being deep.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight episodes of escalating revelation. The stranger isn't random—her identity connects to the other secrets. Each episode ends with a complication. The structure is pure Coben: layers of deception, connected lies, a final reveal that recontextualizes everything. Bingeable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The stranger's identity is revealed, the wife's disappearance is explained, all threads connect. The ending provides closure while leaving open the damage done. Effective thriller resolution. Solid, concluded.</p>
