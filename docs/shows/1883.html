<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">The Duttons travel from Texas to Montana. This is the origin story: how they got the land. Sam Elliott is the cowboy guiding them. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill are the ancestors. Taylor Sheridan's prequel: the West as it was, brutal and beautiful.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Sam Elliott as Shea Brennan: the cowboy leading them. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill as James and Margaret Dutton. Isabel May as Elsa: the narrator and heart. The performances are Western myth made human.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
<p>The Oregon Trail: the Plains, the dangers, the immigrants, the cowboys. The world is the West before it was tamed—every mile earned, every death meaningful.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3><p>Paramount+ production: the West photographed with love and terror. Every frame is Western painting. The land is the character; the journey is the point.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (9/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the West: river crossings, Indian attacks, the landscapes. This is the West as Westerns promised—beautiful and deadly.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>America as journey, what we sacrifice for land, the cost of expansion, immigrants and natives, what the West cost. The show explores these through the wagon train.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Get to Montana. Each episode is the journey: dangers, choices, deaths. The structure is Western odyssey—arrival is the point.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Complete limited series. The Duttons arrive; the origin is told. The ending provides the bridge to Yellowstone. Perfect prequel.</p></div></section>
