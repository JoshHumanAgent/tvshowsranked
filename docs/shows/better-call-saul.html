            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>Better Call Saul shouldn't exist. A prequel to one of television's greatest dramas, focused on a comic relief side character? The premise screams disaster. Instead, it became something rarer: a show that stands beside Breaking Bad as its equal, and in moments of quiet devastation, perhaps even its superior.</p>
            <p>We meet Jimmy McGill as a struggling public defender, living in the back of a nail salon, conning his way toward legitimacy. We know where he ends up—Saul Goodman, criminal lawyer, Cinnabon manager Gene Takovic. The pleasure isn't surprise; it's inevitability watched in slow motion. Every choice Jimmy makes pushes him toward Saul. Every chance at redemption slides through his fingers. By the time he fully becomes the man we met in Breaking Bad, we understand him so completely that the transformation feels tragic rather than comedic.</p>
            <p>But Saul is only half the story. Kim Wexler is the show's great invention—a character who never appeared in Breaking Bad, whose absence in the parent show becomes a mystery Better Call Saul must solve. Rhea Seehorn plays her with a stillness that holds galaxies. Her descent into Jimmy's schemes, her choice to be his partner, her ultimate departure—these form the emotional core that Breaking Bad, for all its brilliance, never quite had.</p>
            <p>Then there's Mike Ehrmantraut, the fixer. His parallel storyline bridges the two shows, showing us the cartel politics that Walter White would later destabilize. Jonathan Banks gives a performance of extraordinary economy—a man who has seen too much, done too much, and now simply does what must be done. His scenes with his granddaughter are the show's heart; his kills are its burden.</p>
            <p>The show trusts patience. Episodes pass without violence. Conversations stretch across scenes. Visual sequences play out without dialogue. This isn't slow television—it's attentive television, asking you to watch faces, notice details, understand that the smallest gesture carries weight.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Characters & Acting (10):</strong> Bob Odenkirk's transformation from Jimmy to Saul to Gene is one of television's great performances. Rhea Seehorn matches him beat for beat—her Kim Wexler is the moral center the show needs. Jonathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, Michael McKean, Patrick Fabian: an ensemble that never misses.</p>
            <p><strong>World Building (10):</strong> Albuquerque exists in full. The legal world, the cartel politics, the strip malls and nursing homes—all interconnected, all plausible. The show expands Breaking Bad's universe without diluting it.</p>
            <p><strong>Conceptual Density (10):</strong> Identity, nature versus choice, the corrosive effect of wanting, the difference between who we are and who we pretend to be. The show explores philosophy through character action, never through lecturing.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution (10):</strong> The final season delivers perfect closure. Jimmy's confession in the courtroom, Kim's visit to the courthouse, Gene's fate—all handled with restraint and earnesty. A finale that honors everything that came before.</p>
