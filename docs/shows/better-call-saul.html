<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Jimmy McGill is a con man trying to go straight. He becomes Saul Goodman. Kim Wexler is the love of his life. Mike Ehrmantraut is the fixer. Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould created the prequel to Breaking Bad: transformation, tragedy, the making of a criminal lawyer.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy/Saul: the transformation is complete—actor and role merged. Rhea Seehorn as Kim: the partner who chooses him, then leaves him. Jonathan Banks as Mike: the moral center of the immoral world. The performances match Breaking Bad's level.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>Albuquerque before Walter White: Jimmy's legal practice, Kim's career, Mike's descent, the cartel. The world expands and connects to Breaking Bad while standing alone. Every detail matters.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>AMC production: Albuquerque rendered with Breaking Bad's visual language, the black-and-white Gene Takovic sequences. The style is patient—this is slow-burn television at its finest.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is character: the transformation, the choices, the consequences. The action (Mike's sequences) is staged with precision, but the show is about people, not explosions.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Identity, transformation, whether we can escape our natures, what we sacrifice for love, the cost of ambition. The show explores these through Jimmy's becoming Saul. Profound prequel.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Jimmy becomes Saul. Kim becomes accomplice. Mike becomes fixer. The structure is tragedy—we know where they end up, the drive is how. The slow burn rewards patience.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Six seasons, complete. The Gene Takovic sequences provide the ending. Jimmy's confession is the resolution. One of television's best conclusions.</p></div></section>
