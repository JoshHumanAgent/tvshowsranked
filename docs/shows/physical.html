            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                San Diego, 1980s. Sheila Rubin is a housewife with an eating disorder, a failing marriage, and a growing obsession with aerobics. Rose Byrne is Sheila—bitter, brilliant, self-destructive, calculating. As her aerobics business grows, so does her capacity for ruthlessness. Annie Weisman created a dark comedy about body image, capitalism, and one woman's journey from invisible housewife to fitness empire. The voiceover is caustic; the transformation is real.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Rose Byrne is phenomenal: the internal monologue she can't stop, the eating disorder she can't escape, the ambition she discovers. Rory Scovel as Danny, her husband, captures the oblivious academic leftist. The supporting cast (Della Saba, Lou Taylor Pucci) creates the San Diego fitness world. Byrne owns every frame.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>1980s San Diego: the beach, the mall, the aerobics studios, the body culture. The period is specific—the rise of fitness videos, the gender politics, the California dream. Sheila's internal world is rendered through voiceover: her darkest thoughts, her self-hatred, her growing confidence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ aesthetics: sun-drenched California, the aerobics classes, the period detail. The style supports the content—the body is Sheila's battleground, photographed with both critique and admiration. The 80s are rendered as they felt, not as cliché.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the body: aerobics sequences, bodies in motion, Sheila's binge-purge cycles (handled delicately). This isn't visual spectacle; it's body spectacle—the 80s fitness craze as both liberation and prison.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Eating disorders, female ambition, capitalism, body image, marriage as prison, entrepreneurship as escape. The show explores what happens when a woman discovers power after years of invisibility—she becomes ruthless, she becomes successful, she becomes someone she might not like. Complex and uncomfortable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season follows Sheila's empire-building: the aerobics class, the video, the business. The drive is her ambition and her obstacles—her husband, her rivals, her eating disorder. The voiceover provides momentum even when plot stalls.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, complete. Sheila's arc resolves—she gets her empire, but at what cost? The ending is ambiguous, appropriate to the character. The journey is more satisfying than the destination.</p>
