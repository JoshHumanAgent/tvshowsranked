            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A young man borrows his father's cab to go to a party. Hours later, he wakes up next to a woman he just met—stabbed to death. He doesn't remember what happened. The criminal justice system swallows him whole. Riz Ahmed is Naz, the Pakistani-American college student transformed by Rikers Island. John Turturro is Jack Stone, the attorney with eczema, bad feet, and an unexpected conscience. The system revealed in forensic detail—how it works, who it works for, who it destroys.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Riz Ahmed's transformation—from naive student to hardened inmate—is physical and psychological. Every scene shows the change. John Turturro's Jack Stone is a character actor's dream: a man who takes the case no one else wanted and finds purpose. The supporting cast—Michael Kenneth Williams, Bill Camp, Jeannie Berlin—creates a complete New York legal ecosystem. Acting that lingers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The system. Not "the system" as abstraction, but the actual machinery: booking, arraignment, Rikers, the court dates, the plea bargains, the family struggling to pay. The show teaches incarceration in eight hours—how it feels, what it costs, who survives it. The world expands from prison cell to mosque to district attorney's office, each location rendered with specific truth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO at its technical best. Rikers shot in actual decommissioned facilities. The visual palette darkens as Naz hardens—light becomes scarcer, shadows deeper. The show uses silence and space; long sequences without dialogue. The camera observes without judging. The aesthetic is documentary-adjacent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is procedural horror: waiting for court dates, navigating prison politics, watching a family unravel under legal costs. The "spectacle" is watching justice administered, watching human beings process a system designed to dehumanize. The power is in the absence of drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores innocence and guilt as legal constructs rather than moral absolutes. Did Naz do it? The answer matters less than demonstrating that the system doesn't care. The show examines race, religion, class—how they affect justice outcomes. The cat is a recurring motif: Stone feeding a stray, the system feeding on humans. Rich with meaning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight episodes of mounting tension. Will Naz take the plea? Will Stone find the truth? What happened that night? The show parcels out information carefully, maintaining uncertainty until the final revelation. Each episode ends with a complication. The pacing is deliberate but never slack. Compulsive viewing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries with appropriate ending. The truth is revealed—not through dramatic courtroom moment but through careful investigation. The resolution is muted: Naz is free but transformed, Stone continues his practice, the system grinds on. The ending respects the show's realism. No triumph, just survival.</p>
