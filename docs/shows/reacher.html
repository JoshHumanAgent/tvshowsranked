            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Jack Reacher drifts into a small Georgia town and is immediately arrested for murder. He didn't do it. He will now solve the crime, violently. Alan Ritchson is the physical embodiment of Lee Child's creation: massive, intelligent, implacable. Each season adapts a different Reacher novel. The formula is pure: a wandering stranger who encounters evil and dismantles it with ruthless efficiency. American vigilante fantasy, executed with competence porn precision.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Alan Ritchson IS Reacher—huge, still, thinking three moves ahead. The performance captures Reacher's physicality and his intelligence. The supporting casts rotate each season; quality varies but is generally solid. Willa Fitzgerald (season 1) and Maria Sten (recurring) provide worthy partners. The villains are appropriately menacing. Functional ensemble elevated by lead.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season creates a small-town ecosystem: corrupt officials, hidden conspiracies, ordinary people trapped by power. The world serves the story—Reacher arrives, identifies evil, destroys it. The military police background provides occasional support. Functional rather than distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Amazon production values: clean, competent, action-forward. The fight choreography is clear—Ritchson's size makes every impact credible. The style is industrial: gets the job done without distinguishing itself. Television action executed professionally.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is physical: Reacher fighting multiple opponents, Reacher improvising weapons, Reacher being shot and walking it off. The action is the point. The show delivers what it promises—satisfying violence against deserving targets. Competence porn as combat exhibition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Good vs. evil, no ambiguity. Reacher is righteous force; his enemies are corrupt, violent, deserving. The show doesn't complicate the fantasy—it delivers it. The themes are thin: justice through violence, institutions failing individuals. Entertainment without depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season is a complete novel adapted: eight episodes of investigation, complication, resolution. The formula is reliable—Reacher arrives, is underestimated, reveals competence, destroys evil. The drive is constant; each episode advances toward the inevitable reckoning. Binge television at its most satisfying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing anthology. Each season resolves; Reacher moves on. The format allows indefinite continuation. The trajectory is familiar—different towns, same justice. The show knows what it is and delivers consistently. Quality maintained; ending irrelevant.</p>
