            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Olivia Pope fixes problems. She's a Washington crisis manager with a team of gladiators and a past with the President. Shonda Rhimes created television's most addictive political thriller: scandals, conspiracies, assassinations, and a love story that wouldn't die. Kerry Washington is Olivia—fierce, brilliant, damaged. The show that invented the phrase "it's handled."
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Kerry Washington is the center: the stride, the coat, the determination, the vulnerability. Tony Goldwyn as President Fitzgerald Grant provides the romantic obsession. The ensemble (Guillermo Díaz, Darby Stanchfield, Katie Lowes, Bellamy Young, Jeff Perry) creates a Shondaland of damaged professionals. The performances embrace the melodrama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Washington, DC: the White House, Olivia Pope & Associates, the secret bunkers, the corrupt institutions. The world is heightened—this is DC as melodrama, not documentary. The political and the personal are always intertwined.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Network drama aesthetics: functional, the Washington locations rendered in grey and blue. The style serves the pace—this is plot television, not visual art. The coats are always perfect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is people in rooms, making phone calls, having confrontations. The "spectacle" is the plot—the scandals, the reveals, the betrayals. The spectacle is narrative.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Power, corruption, love as obsession, whether the ends justify the means, being a Black woman in positions of power. The show touched on race and gender in ways network TV rarely does. The themes are present amid the melodrama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Relentless: every episode ends with a twist, every season escalates the stakes. The structure is designed for addiction—plot piled on plot, secret on secret, soap opera elevated to thriller. The drive is constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Seven seasons with conclusion. The show went where Shonda wanted it to go; the ending provided closure for Olivia. The later seasons expanded conspiracy past credibility, but the finale stuck the landing. Complete.</p>
