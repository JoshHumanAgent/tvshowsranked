            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Elena Gilbert falls in love with two vampire brothers: Stefan (the good one) and Damon (the bad one). The town of Mystic Falls has secrets—vampires, werewolves, witches, and more. Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec adapted L.J. Smith's novels for CW: teen drama with supernatural stakes, love triangles with body counts, eight seasons of addictive television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Nina Dobrev as Elena (and her doppelgänger Katherine) is the center. Paul Wesley as Stefan and Ian Somerhalder as Damon create television's most debated love triangle. The ensemble (Kat Graham, Candice King, Zach Roerig, Michael Trevino) grows across seasons. The performances embrace the melodrama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Mystic Falls: the founding families, the supernatural history, the constant threat. The world expands across seasons—the Original vampires, the Other Side, the Gemini coven. The mythology is deep and maintained.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>CW production: high school hallways, woods at night, mansions with secrets. The style serves the teen drama—beautiful people in supernatural situations. The effects improve across eight seasons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Vampire speed, werewolf transformations, witch magic, doppelgänger confrontations. The spectacle is CW-budget supernatural—enough to sell the fantasy, not enough to impress. The romance is the real spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Love, sacrifice, whether monsters can be good, family as both blessing and curse. The themes are present but secondary to the romance and the plot. The philosophy is teen drama depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Relentless: love triangles, villain arcs, season-long mysteries, constant stakes. The structure is designed for addiction—every episode ends with a twist or a kiss. The drive never stops across eight seasons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Eight seasons with conclusion. The love triangle resolves; the characters get their endings. The finale satisfies the fanbase. The Vampire Diaries is complete, with spinoffs (The Originals, Legacies) continuing the world.</p>
