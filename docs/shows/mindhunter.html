            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">FBI agents Holden Ford and Bill Tench interview serial killers to understand how they think. Wendy Carr studies the interviews. Together they develop criminal profiling. David Fincher adapts John Douglas's memoir: the birth of behavioral science, the cost of understanding monsters.</p>
            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Jonathan Groff as Holden: the agent whose curiosity becomes obsession. Holt McCallany as Bill: the experienced agent watching Holden spiral. Anna Torv as Wendy: the academic who sees what they can't. The serial killers (Cameron Britton as Ed Kemper is iconic) are terrifying.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>1970s-80s America: the FBI Academy, the prisons, the crime scenes. The world is the birth of profiling—when "serial killer" wasn't a term, when understanding monsters was controversial. The period detail is perfect.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>David Fincher's direction: the interiors, the lighting, the precise frames. The style is clinical—the camera observes the killers with Holden. Netflix production at its finest.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the interviews: watching Holden talk to Ed Kemper, Richard Speck, Charles Manson. No action, just conversation with evil. The spectacle is psychological.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>What makes killers, whether we can understand evil, what it costs to study monsters, nature vs. nurture. The show explores these through the interviews and the agents' deterioration.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Serial killer interviews mixed with active cases: the method works, but Holden's obsession grows. The structure is investigation—the drive is understanding.</p></div>
            <div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Two seasons, cancelled. The third season was planned; the ending is incomplete. Fincher moved to other projects. What exists is excellent; what's missing hurts.</p></div>
