            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Marry My Husband is a Korean drama about a woman who discovers her husband is having an affair with her best friend, dies in a confrontation, and wakes up ten years earlier with the chance to change her fate. The premise is a fusion of familiar elements—time travel, revenge, second chances—but the execution has a specific pleasure: watching someone who was victimized by everyone around her learn to fight back with foreknowledge of what's coming.</p>

            <p>Park Min-young plays Kang Ji-won, the wronged wife who reawakens in her younger body but retains her memories of betrayal. What follows is methodical revenge: she will not repeat the mistakes that led to her death, and she will ensure that those who destroyed her face consequences instead. The drama's pleasure is in the systematic dismantling of enemies who don't know they're being targeted, and in Ji-won's gradual discovery that she deserves better than what she accepted before.</p>

            <p>The romance with a new love interest provides emotional counterweight to the revenge plot, but the show's heart is in Ji-won's self-actualization. She was trained to accept less, to be grateful for scraps, to serve others' needs before her own. Her time-travel second chance is really permission to want things for herself. The drama doesn't break new ground in the revenge genre, but it executes its formula with conviction and a lead performance that makes Ji-won's transformation satisfying to watch.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Marry My Husband earns its ranking through competent execution of a satisfying revenge fantasy with strong lead performance. The score reflects entertainment value without formal innovation.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Park Min-young carries the show with emotional range that makes Ji-won's transformation credible. The villain husband and best friend are effectively hateable without being cartoonish. The romantic lead is charming if slightly underwritten. The ensemble serves the revenge fantasy.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Corporate Korea provides the setting—office politics, social hierarchies, family expectations that trap women in subordinate positions. The time travel element is accepted without explanation; the world is primarily a vehicle for the revenge fantasy rather than a fully realized environment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Standard K-drama aesthetics: polished production, attractive leads, competent direction that serves the story without distinctive visual identity. The contrast between past and present timelines is handled clearly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle beyond the attractive production design. This is relationship drama with revenge elements—visual interest is in emotional beats and confrontations rather than effects or action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (5.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores themes of self-worth, the costs of submission to others' expectations, and the satisfaction of watching the undeserving face consequences. The ideas are present but subordinate to the revenge fantasy satisfaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The revenge structure provides clear momentum—each episode moves Ji-won closer to her goals while obstacles emerge from enemies who don't know they're being targeted. The 16-episode count is standard for K-drama and appropriate to the story's scope.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending delivers expected satisfaction: villains punished, romance resolved, heroine transformed. The resolution is appropriate to the genre without surprising. Ji-won's journey from victim to victor feels earned within the show's logic.</p>
