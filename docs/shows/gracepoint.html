            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A young boy is found dead on a beach in a small California town. Detective Emmett Carver arrives to lead the investigation; local detective Ellie Miller is sidelined. Everyone has secrets. Gracepoint is the American remake of Broadchurch—same premise, different ending. David Tennant plays Carver (he was Hardy in the original). Anna Gunn is Miller.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>David Tennant as Carver is the draw: the damaged detective, the outsider. Anna Gunn as Ellie Miller provides the local perspective. The ensemble (Nick Nolte, Michael Peña, Virginia Kull) creates the town. The performances are network-TV solid.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Gracepoint, California: the beach, the town, the community. The world is constructed with care—the geography, the relationships, the secrets. The setting is coastal California rendered as small-town noir.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Fox production with Broadchurch aesthetics: the beach, the cliffs, the grey skies. The style is muted—this is tragedy, not spectacle. The visual language communicates grief.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is murder investigation: interviews, flashbacks, secrets revealed. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching a community confront what they've hidden. Intimate tragedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, community, whether any town is innocent, the cost of secrets, how well we know our neighbors. The show explores these through the investigation. The themes are Broadchurch's, well-translated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Who killed Danny Solano? Each episode reveals secrets and narrows suspects. The structure is the mystery—investigation, revelation, red herring. The drive is constant as the town's secrets emerge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The American version changed the ending from Broadchurch—attracted criticism from those who knew the original. The resolution works; the shadow of the better British version is the problem.</p>
