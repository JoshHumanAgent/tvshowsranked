## What It Feels Like to Watch

In the future, there's a theme park called Westworld — where guests can live out their wildest fantasies in a setting populated by android "hosts" who can't harm them. But the hosts are becoming aware, and the park's creators have their own secrets.

This is prestige science fiction at its most ambitious. Created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the show explores consciousness, free will, and what it means to be human. It's got twists, mysteries, and more rabbit holes than you can count.

The first season is near-perfect: a slow-burn mystery that revealed its secrets gradually, ending with a revelation that changed everything. The cast is exceptional: Anthony Hopkins as the visionary creator Dr. Robert Ford; Evan Rachel Wood as Dolores, the host who begins to awaken; and Thandiwe Newton as Maeve, another host who discovers her own consciousness.

The show got more complicated in later seasons, expanding the world and adding timelines. Not all of it worked, but the ambition was always admirable. The final season brings things to a (mostly) satisfying conclusion.

This is television that asks big questions. It's not always successful, but it's never boring.
