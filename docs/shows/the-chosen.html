            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The life of Jesus, told through the eyes of those who met him. Simon Peter is a fisherman in debt. Matthew is a tax collector shunned by his community. Mary Magdalene is tormented by demons. They encounter a rabbi who changes everything. Dallas Jenkins created the first multi-season Jesus story, crowdfunded and distributed free. Jonathan Roumie is Jesus—warm, approachable, fully human.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jonathan Roumie's Jesus is remarkable: the humanity, the warmth, the moments of divine authority. The disciples are distinct personalities—Simon's impulsiveness, Matthew's autism-coded precision, Nicodemus's doubt. The performances ground the sacred in the everyday.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>First-century Galilee: the fishing villages, the tax booths, the synagogues, the Roman occupation. The world is researched and rendered with care. The Jews under Rome are a people waiting for deliverance. The context enriches the story.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Crowdfunded production: the budget shows, but so does the commitment. The landscapes (filmed in Texas and Utah standing in for Israel) are beautiful. The style is functional—the message matters more than the aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The miracles are staged with restraint—this is not effects-driven. The "spectacle" is character: watching people encounter something that changes them. The production value increases with seasons; the focus remains on story.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Incarnation, discipleship, the human Jesus, the first-century context of Messiah. The show explores what it meant to follow Jesus before Christianity existed. The theology is Protestant/evangelical but generally inclusive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic encounters with serialized development: each episode features a disciple meeting Jesus; the seasons build toward ministry, passion, resurrection. The pacing is deliberate—this is character study, not action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing with planned seven seasons. The show is currently in the ministry years; passion and resurrection are future. The creators have a roadmap; distribution is planned through completion. Currently mid-story.</p>
