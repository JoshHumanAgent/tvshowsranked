            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Swedish winter that never ends. A detective who carries every case in his bones, whose face shows the accumulated weight of human cruelty. Kenneth Branagh (or Krister Henriksson, depending on the version) inhabits Kurt Wallander—a man who solves crimes because he can't not, who suffers because he sees too clearly. The crimes are brutal; the atmosphere is gray; the resolution brings no joy. Nordic noir perfected.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Kenneth Branagh's Wallander is a masterpiece of physical acting—the slump, the thousand-yard stare, the way he inhabits exhaustion like a second skin. The supporting cast across all versions is uniformly strong. This is acting as revelation: we understand Wallander through what he can't say, through silences and glances and the way he holds a coffee cup like it might be his last.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Ystad, Sweden—a small town where terrible things happen. The setting is crucial: flat landscapes, endless beaches, gray skies, summer nights that never darken. The world is specifically Swedish: the welfare state that can't prevent horror, the polite society concealing rage, the isolation that breeds both introspection and violence. Henning Mankell's creation is rendered with complete authenticity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The BBC version, shot in Sweden, is visually stunning. The widescreen compositions emphasize isolation—small figures against vast, indifferent landscapes. The color palette is deliberately muted: grays, blues, the occasional red of blood or emergency lights. This is cinematography as emotional storytelling. Every frame communicates melancholy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is environmental: Swedish landscapes in all seasons, rendered with painterly attention. But this isn't action television. The spectacle is internal—watching a character process grief, recognizing the moment when hope dies. The production value serves atmosphere, not set pieces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Wallander's cases explore Swedish society: immigration, generational conflict, the collision of modern Europe with traditional Scandinavia. The show uses crime as social criticism without becoming didactic. Wallander himself embodies a question: what happens to a man who witnesses humanity at its worst every day and can't look away?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Slow burn by design. Each case unfolds over 90 minutes, allowing for investigation, reflection, false leads, and the gradual accumulation of truth. The pacing is deliberate—this is television that asks you to sit with discomfort. Viewers seeking momentum will find it too slow; viewers seeking depth will find it rewarding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each adaptation has its own ending. The BBC version concluded with "The White Wall," a final case that forces Wallander to confront mortality and memory. The Swedish versions continue further into Mankell's novels. The endings honor the character: no triumph, just the continuation of work and the small consolations of family. Appropriate to the tone.</p>
