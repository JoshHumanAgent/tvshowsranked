            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Catherine arrives in Russia to marry Emperor Peter. He's an idiot. She decides to kill him and take the throne. Elle Fanning is Catherine; Nicholas Hoult is Peter. Tony McNamara created "an occasionally true story": historical farce as political satire, 18th-century Russia rendered as absurdist comedy.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Elle Fanning as Catherine: the idealist who becomes ruthless. Nicholas Hoult as Peter: the idiot king who becomes almost sympathetic. The supporting cast (Phoebe Fox, Sacha Dhawan, Charity Wakefield) creates the absurd court. The performances are theatrical and perfect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>18th-century Russia as playground: the court, the politics, the violence, the absurdity. The world is stylized history—real enough to matter, absurd enough to work. The aesthetic is distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Hulu production: sumptuous costumes, palace interiors, the Russian winter. The style is theatrical—the camera observes the absurdity. Beautiful and biting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the court: the costumes, the ceremonies, the occasional violence. The production is lavish; the tone is satirical. The spectacle serves the comedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Enlightenment idealism vs. realpolitik, whether ideals survive power, the cost of revolution, men in power vs. women who want it. The show explores these through comedy that cuts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Catherine's coup: each season is a phase of her plot. The structure is farce with stakes—will she kill him, will she succeed, what will power cost? The drive is constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, cancelled. Catherine takes power; the story was continuing. The cancellation left threads unresolved. The journey is excellent; the destination is incomplete.</p>
