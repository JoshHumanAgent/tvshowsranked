            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                An alien arrives on Earth to save his dying planet. He must become human, navigate capitalism, and find a solution before it's too late. Chiwetel Ejiofor is the alien; Naomie Harris is the scientist who helps him. Based on Walter Tevis's novel (and the David Bowie film), with Bill Nighy as the previous visitor who failed. Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet create something philosophical and strange: alien as immigrant, sci-fi as character study.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Chiwetel Ejiofor is extraordinary: the alien learning to be human, the discomfort in a body, the wonder at our strangeness. Naomie Harris provides the human connection. Bill Nighy (in limited appearances) connects to the film. The performances elevate the premise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Earth through alien eyes: capitalism, technology, love, death, all new and strange. The alien's planet is rendered in glimpses—sufficient for stakes, not overwhelming. The world is the one we know, made unfamiliar.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Showtime production: Earth rendered with alien perspective, the alien's perceptions visualized. The style serves the character—the camera sees what the alien sees. Some effects are budget-constrained; the performances carry it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is sci-fi: the alien planet glimpsed, the technology, the departure. The show prioritizes character over effects. The "spectacle" is watching Ejiofor learn to be human.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Immigration, capitalism, what it means to be human, whether humanity deserves saving, the cost of adaptation. The alien as outsider perspective allows critique of human systems. The themes are present in the structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The clock is ticking: the planet is dying, the alien must succeed. The drive is survival—can he learn enough, fast enough, to save his people? The pacing is deliberate—character study with stakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The story resolves—alien and human fates are decided. The ending provides closure while leaving room for continuation that never came. Satisfying on its own terms.</p>
