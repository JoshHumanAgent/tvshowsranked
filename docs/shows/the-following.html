            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Joe Carroll was a literature professor who became a serial killer, inspired by Edgar Allan Poe. He built a cult of followers who will kill for him. Ryan Hardy is the FBI agent who caught him—and who Carroll now torments from prison. Kevin Bacon is Hardy; James Purefoy is Carroll. Cat and mouse, cult dynamics, elaborate kills. Kevin Williamson's Fox thriller: stylish, violent, formula-testing.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Kevin Bacon is the damaged FBI agent, carrying the show through its convolutions. James Purefoy as Joe Carroll is charismatic and terrifying—a villain who seduces through intellect. The followers vary in quality. The leads carry the premise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Carroll's cult: followers everywhere, embedded in society, activated by code words and Poe references. The world is paranoid—anyone could be a follower. The mythology expands across seasons, sometimes beyond credibility.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Network thriller aesthetics: murders staged for impact, cult gatherings in dramatic locations. The style serves the premise without distinguishing. The violence is network-allowed but pushes boundaries.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is violence: elaborate kills, mass murders, cult rituals. The murders are staged for maximum impact. The spectacle serves the thriller—cultist attacks, Carroll's theatricality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Cults, obsession, literature as inspiration for violence, the relationship between hunter and hunted. The themes are present but secondary to the thriller mechanics. Poe is decorative more than meaningful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Relentless: Carroll escapes, cultists attack, Hardy pursues. The show is designed for momentum—each episode ends with a twist or escalation. The structure is cat-and-mouse with ever-increasing stakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, cancelled. The escalating cult premise became unsustainable—how many followers could one man have? The show began to strain credibility. The ending was produced but the concept had exhausted itself.</p>
