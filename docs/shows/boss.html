            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Tom Kane is the mayor of Chicago. He's also dying of a degenerative neurological disease that he's hiding from everyone. Kelsey Grammer plays against type as the ruthless politician who controls everything while his body fails. Farhad Safinia created political Shakespeare: power, betrayal, legacy.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Kelsey Grammer as Tom Kane: terrifying, vulnerable, Shakespearean. This is Grammer like you've never seen him. The supporting cast (Connie Nielsen, Hannah Ware, Martin Donovan) matches his intensity. The performances are prestige television at its finest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Chicago politics: the machine, the alliances, the betrayals. The city is rendered as Kane's kingdom—everyone answers to the mayor. The political machinery is complete and corrupt.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz production: Chicago photographed with political drama gravity, Kane's decline visualized with care. The style serves the performance—Kane is the center of every frame.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is political: backroom deals, public betrayals, private moments of decline. The "spectacle" is Kane's body failing while his mind remains. Character drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Power and its costs, the body vs. the legacy, whether we can outrun our sins, political corruption as way of life. The show explores Machiavelli through a dying king.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Kane's secret: the disease, the political enemies, the family betrayal. Each episode escalates the danger. The structure is Shakespearean tragedy—the fall is inevitable, the question is how.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, cancelled. The story is incomplete—Kane's fall was planned but not finished. The cancellation denied the full tragedy. What exists is excellent; what's missing hurts.</p>
