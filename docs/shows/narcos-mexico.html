            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The origin of Mexico's drug war. 1980s Guadalajara: Félix Gallardo is building the cartel that will become the model for all cartels. Kiki Camarena is the DEA agent who gets too close. Diego Luna and Michael Peña anchor a story that spirals across decades, showing how America's drug war created the monsters it claimed to fight. Narcos shifted from Colombia to Mexico; the product became the infrastructure, the violence became the state.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Diego Luna as Félix Gallardo is charismatic predator: soft-spoken, ruthless, building an empire through patience and violence. Michael Peña as Kiki Camarena brings desperation and dedication. The supporting cast (Tenoch Huerta, Teresa Ruiz, Scoot McNairy) creates depth. The performances are solid without being transcendent; the material sometimes overwhelms character development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Mexico across decades: the 1980s emergence, the violence escalation, the state complicity, the American intervention. The show explains how cartels work—logistics, politics, corruption. The world expands across seasons, each covering a different era. Educational in the best sense: crime drama as history lesson.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production values: Mexico rendered in heat and dust, the contrast between cartel luxury and peasant poverty. The style matches the original Narcos—documentary-adjacent, explanatory captions, period detail. The violence is staged with impact without gratuitousness. Visual competence serving historical material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Violence as spectacle: assassinations, torture, the brutal enforcement of cartel discipline. The production design captures 1980s Mexico; the action sequences are competent. The spectacle is in the scale—the empire Felix builds, the violence it requires. Not gratuitous, but unflinching.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The drug war as self-perpetuating system. The show explores American complicity, Mexican corruption, the economics of prohibition. Felix's genius was infrastructure—uniting independent traffellers into a federation. The show asks how crime becomes industry and industry becomes state. Sophisticated without being academic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons of escalating conflict. Season 1 builds Felix's empire and Kiki's investigation; subsequent seasons track the war's expansion. The pacing varies—some stretches feel repetitive, others are propulsive. The structure is historical, which limits dramatic satisfaction. Momentum sufficient without being constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons covering decades of drug war. The ending is historical, not dramatic—the war continues, the cartels fragment, America's intervention creates new problems. The conclusion is open, appropriate to ongoing reality. Resolution means "we've told this chapter," not "the story ends."</p>
