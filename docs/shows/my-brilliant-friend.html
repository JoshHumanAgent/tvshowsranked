            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Two girls in 1950s Naples, growing up poor, growing apart, growing together. Elena Ferrante's novels adapted for television with complete fidelity: the dust, the violence, the shoes that matter because you have none. Lila is brilliant, feral, trapped. Lenù is observant, literate, escaping. Their friendship is the central relationship of their lives—competitive, supportive, impossible to untangle. This is female friendship rendered with unprecedented complexity.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The casting across ages is miraculous: child actors who grow into teenagers who grow into adults, all of them embodying the same characters. Elisa Del Genio and Ludovica Nasti as young Lenù and Lila establish the dynamic; Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace extend it. Every performance feels lived rather than acted. The supporting cast creates an entire neighborhood of distinct personalities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The rione—Naples neighborhood—is as much a character as the girls. The Camorra's shadow, the poverty, the limited options for women, the class hierarchies, the political currents. The show renders mid-century Naples in forensic detail: the apartments, the shops, the dusty streets, the beach. World-building through accumulation rather than explanation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Shot on location in Naples, the series looks authentic in a way most period dramas don't. The color palette evolves with the decades: the dusty browns of the 1950s, the brighter colors of the 1960s, the political posters of the 1970s. The camera observes without judging. The visual storytelling is patient and cumulative.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>This isn't spectacle television. The spectacle is the world rendered complete: Naples as it was, poverty as it felt, the limited horizons of working-class girls in postwar Italy. The production value serves authenticity, not awe. The "spectacle" is emotional—the accumulation of small moments that become a life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores female friendship with novelistic depth: the competition, the identification, the ways women are formed by and against each other. Class, education, politics, feminism—these themes interweave without dominating. The friendship is the lens through which everything else is understood. This is television as serious literature.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The pacing is deliberate—this is a life story, not a thriller. Episodes accumulate rather than accelerate. The drive comes from wanting to know what happens to these women, not from plot mechanics. Viewers seeking momentum may be frustrated; viewers seeking immersion will be rewarded. The show demands patience and rewards it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons covering Ferrante's four Neapolitan novels. The adaptation is complete and faithful. The ending is appropriate—not triumphant, not tragic, just the continuation of lives we've come to know intimately. The show respects its source material while adding its own artistic dimension. A model of literary adaptation.</p>
