## What It Feels Like to Watch

Lena Dunham's *Girls* arrived in 2012 like a splinter in the side of everything we thought we knew about "prestige television." Here was a show about young women who were not beautiful in the traditional sense, not nice in the way we expected women on TV to be, not successful or aspirational or even particularly likeable. They were just... human.

The series follows Hannah Horvath and her three closest friends — Marnie, Jessa, and Shoshanna — as they stumble through their twenties in New York City. Hannah wants to be a writer. Marnie wants to matter. Jessa wants to feel something. Shoshanna wants to stop being a virgin. Their dreams are modest, their failures are frequent, and their friendships are as messy as real friendships are.

What made *Girls* controversial was its refusal to soften its characters. They make terrible decisions. They hurt each other. They lie to themselves and each other. And yet, somehow, you recognize them. Not because you've lived their exact lives, but because you've felt what they feel: the terror of being an adult, the loneliness of cities, the way friendships curdle when everyone is figuring themselves out.

The show has a willingness to be ugly — not visually, but emotionally. Characters have embarrassing sexual encounters, humiliate themselves at work, say the wrong thing at the worst possible moment. There's a rawness here that was groundbreaking for its time, even if subsequent shows have copied the formula.

Adam Driver's performance as Adam Sackler is career-defining. He's awful and fascinating and occasionally tender — a man-child who somehow grows up across six seasons. The supporting cast is equally strong, particularly Adam Driver and Alex Bledel as the two most significant romantic interests who are never quite right for the women they pursue.

By the final season, *Girls* had evolved into something unexpected: a show about what happens when your twenties end and you realize you're not who you thought you'd be. The finale, "Latching," is a quiet, ambiguous meditation on motherhood and identity that divided viewers but felt true to everything that came before.

This is not a show for everyone. It can be frustrating, self-indulgent, and too in love with its own voice. But for those it connects with — particularly anyone who has ever felt lost in a city, or lost in their own head — it feels like being seen.
