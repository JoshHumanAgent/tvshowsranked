<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">The Roses are rich, then they're not. They move to Schitt's Creek, a town they bought as a joke. Eugene Levy and Dan Levy (his son) created warm comedy about entitled people learning to care. The show that got better every season.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Eugene Levy as Johnny, Catherine O'Hara as Moira, Dan Levy as David, Annie Murphy as Alexis. The performances create entitlement and growth. Catherine O'Hara is legendary.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Schitt's Creek: the motel, the town, the locals (Patrick, Twyla, Ronnie, Stevie). The world is small town as redemption.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>CBC production: the motel, the town, the visual language of Canadian sitcom. Functional but warm.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is a family in a motel. The "spectacle" is watching terrible people become better.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Class, redemption, queer coming-out, family love, small-town value. The show explores these with warmth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Each Rose learns to be human. David's romance with Patrick. Alexis's growth. The drive is character transformation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Six seasons, complete. The ending is perfect—the Roses leave but stay connected. The wedding is earned. Heartwarming finale.</p></div></section>
