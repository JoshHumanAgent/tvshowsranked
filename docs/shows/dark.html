<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A child disappears in a small German town. Then another. The investigation reveals a time travel conspiracy spanning generations. Dark is Netflix's first German original: complex, philosophical, time travel as destiny and doom.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Louis Hofmann, Maja Schöne, Oliver Masucci—the cast plays multiple versions across time. The performances hold the complexity together. The transitions between ages are seamless.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (10/10)</h3><p>Winden: the nuclear plant, the caves, the 33-year cycle. The world is built with scientific precision—time travel has rules, and every trip has consequences. Complete mythology.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: the German forest, the rain, the 1950s/1980s/2040s rendered in distinct palettes. The style is ominous—this is time travel as horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the caves, the time machine, the apocalyptic future. The production visualizes temporal mechanics with clarity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Time, determinism, whether we can change fate, the bootstrap paradox, generational trauma. The show explores these with philosophical depth. Requires attention.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>The mystery unfolds across three seasons—who is the father, the killer, the origin. The structure is puzzle—the drive is understanding. Each season deepens the complexity.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (10/10)</h3><p>Three seasons, complete. The ending resolves the causality loop, answers the questions, satisfies the philosophy. One of television's most complex narratives, perfectly concluded.</p></div></section>
