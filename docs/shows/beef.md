## What It Feels Like to Watch

Two strangers have a road rage incident in a parking lot. One is a failing contractor. The other is an unfulfilled entrepreneur. What follows is one of the most unexpectedly profound character studies in recent television.

*BEEF* works because it understands that anger is rarely about the thing we're angry about. Danny Cho (Steven Yeun) and Amy Lau (Ali Wong) are both stuck — in careers that don't fulfill them, in relationships that don't nourish them, in lives that feel like they're slipping away. Their feud becomes an outlet for everything else that's wrong.

The show is created by Lee Sung Jin and produced by A24, and it has that A24 sensibility: unflinching, darkly comic, willing to sit with discomfort. The pacing is deliberately slow, letting you understand these people before judging them. And you will judge them — they make terrible decisions, hurt innocent people, and generally behave badly. But you understand why.

Steven Yeun is magnificent as Danny — a man whose anger masks deep grief and insecurity. Ali Wong matches him beat for beat as Amy — polished, successful, and quietly furious. Their performances are raw, vulnerable, and often funny in the darkest ways.

The supporting cast is strong, particularly Danny's brother Paul and Amy's husband George, who get drawn into the conflict and suffer their own consequences.

What elevates *BEEF* above a simple revenge story is its generosity. It refuses to make either character the villain. They're both struggling, both hurting, both looking for something the world hasn't given them. The show asks whether connection is possible between people who can't stop hurting each other.

The finale is devastating — not because of violence, but because of recognition. Two people who have spent ten episodes destroying each other's lives finally see each other, and themselves.
