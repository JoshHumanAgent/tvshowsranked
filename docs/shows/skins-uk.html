<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Bristol teens party, fuck up, and try to survive. Each generation brings new faces. Effy is the throughline. The show that made teen drama raw: drugs, eating disorders, mental illness, family—nothing softened. British youth as it actually was.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>The casts rotated every two seasons: Nicholas Hoult, Kaya Scodelario, Hannah Murray, Dev Patel. Each generation had its standouts. Effy is iconic.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Bristol: the parties, the homes, the schools. Working-class teen life rendered authentically. The world is specific to British youth culture.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>E4 production: handheld, party scenes, the visual language of teen drama. The style matches the chaos of youth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. Teen life: parties, bedrooms, streets. The "spectacle" is how raw it gets.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Teen mental health, addiction, sexuality, family dysfunction, friendship as survival. Gen Z before Gen Z had a name.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Each episode focuses on one character. The structure lets each teen have their story. The drive is character exploration.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3><p>Seven seasons, complete. Each generation got resolution. Effy's story concluded in "Skins: Rise." A defining show of its era.</p></div></section>
