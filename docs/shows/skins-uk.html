            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Skins is a British teen drama that follows a group of Bristol teenagers through their final years of school, capturing their parties, relationships, family dramas, and various forms of self-destruction with a frankness that made it controversial and influential. The show premiered in 2007 and ran for seven seasons, with each two-season generation focusing on a new cohort of teenagers. The format allowed the show to refresh before its characters aged out of teen drama.</p>

            <p>What distinguished Skins from American teen dramas was its aesthetic: rapid editing, stylized sequences, a willingness to show teenage life as teenagers experienced it rather than as adults wanted it depicted. The characters drink, take drugs, have sex, and make catastrophically bad decisions, but the show's judgment is suspended—they're presented as works in progress rather than moral lessons. Some episodes were written by teenagers, contributing to the authenticity that critics found either refreshing or dangerous.</p>

            <p>The first generation—Effy, Tony, Jal, Chris, and others—established the show's tone: beautiful, damaged young people hurting each other and themselves in ways that felt genuinely unpredictable. The show's most powerful moments came from its willingness to follow consequences to their logical ends: death, mental illness, the permanent damage that teenage choices can create. It was never a show about teenagers learning valuable lessons; it was about teenagers surviving or not surviving the process of becoming adults.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Skins earns its ranking through authentic teen perspective, generational refresh format, and willingness to show consequences. The score reflects a show that was influential without being formally innovative.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show launched several careers—Nicholas Hoult, Dev Patel, Kaya Scodelario—and discovered young actors with genuine presence. Each generation creates distinct personalities with authentic teenage energy. The performances are raw in ways that professional adult acting isn't, which serves the material.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>Bristol teenage life is rendered with attention to how teenagers actually live: parties, drugs, awkward sex, family dysfunction that you can't escape yet. The world feels specific to place and class in ways that American teen dramas often aren't.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show's visual style was distinctive: rapid editing, montage sequences set to contemporary music, a handheld aesthetic that suggested documentary authenticity. The direction elevated teen drama above its conventional visual language.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is in youth itself—beautiful young people, parties, substance-fueled experiences. There are no effects sequences. The visual pleasure is in watching attractive people in heightened emotional states.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores what happens when adults abdicate responsibility for teenagers, how young people create families from friends, the consequences of treating adolescence as preparation for adulthood rather than lived experience. The themes emerge from character rather than lecture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The generational structure creates natural endpoints—characters graduate, new characters arrive. Individual episodes focus on single characters, creating depth at the cost of overall momentum. The show is more character study than plot engine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Each generation ends, but endings vary in satisfaction. Some characters get resolution; others disappear or die in ways that feel arbitrary rather than meaningful. The show's commitment to unpredictability sometimes worked against narrative coherence.</p>
