            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A small French mountain town. The dead return—not as zombies, but as themselves, unchanged, unaware they've been gone. A teenage girl killed in a bus crash walks home. A boy murdered years ago knocks on his mother's door. They want to resume their lives, but their families have moved on, and something else is gathering in the forests. French supernatural at its most elegant: no jump scares, just dread, and the impossibility of the past returning.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The ensemble creates a community of grief and impossible return: Clotilde Hesme as the mother whose daughter returns, Frédéric Pierrot as the doctor treating the inexplicable, Anne Consigny as the woman who lost her lover. The performances are restrained, French, internal. The children who return are particularly effective—innocent, confused, slowly becoming something other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The town as pressure vessel: the dam above it, the forest around it, the school, the bar, the homes where the dead now sleep. The world expands with each returnee, each connection to the past. The atmosphere is specific: gray skies, cold mountains, the weight of water held back. The world is complete and unsettling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual style is distinctive: muted colors, shallow focus, the French Alps rendered as liminal space. Mogwai's soundtrack creates atmosphere without melody. The show looks unlike anything else—European art-film aesthetics applied to genre material. Beautiful and disturbing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is the supernatural as mood: people who shouldn't be here, are here. The spectacle is emotional—watching families confront the dead returned, watching the returned realize something is wrong. Atmospheric rather than action-oriented.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Grief, the impossibility of return, the cost of holding on. The show explores what happens when loss is reversed: do you want your dead back? Can you love them the same way? The returned are different—something has changed. The allegory is sophisticated: this is resurrection as horror, not comfort.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The first season is eight episodes of accumulating mystery: who are the returned? Why now? What do they want? The drive is curiosity rather than urgency. The second season expands the mythology but loses some momentum. Patient viewers rewarded; action-seekers frustrated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons with diminishing returns. The first season is near-perfect; the second doesn't match its control. The ending is ambitious but unsatisfying—the show reaches for profundity and loses focus. What began as precise dread ends as confused mythology. The journey exceeds the destination.</p>
