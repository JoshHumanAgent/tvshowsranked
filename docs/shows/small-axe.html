            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Five films, one community. London's West Indian diaspora from the 1960s to 1980s: the Mangrove restaurant trial, the education system failing Black children, the police harassment, the dance parties that were resistance, the dreams deferred and the dreams achieved. Steve McQueen (the filmmaker, not the actor) creates a cinematic testimony—"small axe" from the proverb: small axe cut down big tree. Each film is complete; together they compose an epic of Black British survival and joy.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each film features distinct performances: Letitia Wright and Shaun Parkes in "Mangrove," the courtroom drama; John Boyega in "Red, White and Blue" as a man joining the police to change them; Micheal Ward and Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn in "Lovers Rock," the house party as liberation. The casting is precise, the performances uniformly excellent. This is cinema acting in television format.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>West London across decades: Notting Hill before gentrification, the front rooms, the blues parties, the police stations, the restaurants. Each film creates a specific time and place with meticulous detail. The world expands across films—characters recur, references cross-pollinate. A community rendered in five facets, each complete, each connected.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Steve McQueen is a filmmaker, not a television director. Each film is shot like cinema. "Lovers Rock" alone is worth watching for its house party sequence—light, movement, sound creating something approaching religious experience. The camera work is patient, observant, beautiful. This is visual art.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle varies: courtroom drama in "Mangrove," domestic conflict in "Education," dance floor ecstasy in "Lovers Rock." The spectacle is emotional rather than production-driven. McQueen finds beauty in community spaces, in faces, in movement. Modest budgets, extraordinary vision.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each film carries its themes: institutional racism, community resistance, generational conflict, the limits of assimilation, joy as survival strategy. "Small axe" is the central metaphor: a small community can challenge power. The anthology format allows McQueen to explore different angles of diaspora experience. Intellectual without being academic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each film is self-contained, so narrative momentum is episodic. "Mangrove" is courtroom procedural; "Lovers Rock" is almost plotless—a party and its aftermath. The drive comes from character and atmosphere rather than plot twists. Patient viewers will be rewarded; action seekers may struggle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each film provides resolution—trials conclude, parties end, educations transform. The anthology structure means no single ending, but each ending is appropriate. "Red, White and Blue" ends on uncomfortable optimism; "Education" ends with possibility. McQueen resists easy triumph while delivering emotional completion.</p>
