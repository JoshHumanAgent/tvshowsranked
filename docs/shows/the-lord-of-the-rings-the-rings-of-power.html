            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The Second Age of Middle-earth. Galadriel hunts Sauron. Elrond builds alliances. The dwarves mine mithril. The island kingdom of Númenor rises and will fall. Amazon spent a billion dollars to bring Tolkien's backstory to screen—before the Rings, before the Last Alliance, when Sauron was a whisper. The most expensive television ever made.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Morfydd Clark as Galadriel is intense—some argue too intense. Robert Aramayo as Elrond provides political intrigue. Charlie Vickers' reveal (no spoilers) changes everything. The ensemble creates the Second Age's key players. The performances are earnest; the dialogue is sometimes clunky.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Middle-earth's Second Age: Númenor, Khazad-dûm, Lindon, the Southlands that will become Mordor. The world is rendered with spectacular detail. The lore is Tolkien's; the expansions are Amazon's. The world is the show's greatest success.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Amazon's billion dollars on screen: the cities, the landscapes, the battles. The production design rivals the Jackson films. The visual language establishes Middle-earth's Second Age as distinct from the Third. Stunning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (10/10)</h3>
                <p>The most spectacular television ever made: Númenor in its glory, Khazad-dûm before the fall, the forging of the Rings, the eruption of Mount Doom. Every frame costs money, and every frame shows it. Spectacle as television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Power, corruption, the seduction of order, the fall of empires. Tolkien's themes are present: Númenor's pride, the Rings' temptation, Sauron's manipulation. The show explores the Second Age's tragedy. The depth is Tolkien's; the execution is sometimes shallow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Multiple storylines across Middle-earth: Galadriel's hunt, Elrond's politics, the Harfoots' migration, the Southlands' conflict. The first season connects slowly; the second accelerates. The pacing has been criticized as slow. Patient viewers reward.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing with multi-season commitment. The Second Age story is known (Númenor falls, the Rings corrupt, the Last Alliance). How Amazon reaches those endpoints is the question. Currently building toward the known tragedy.</p>
