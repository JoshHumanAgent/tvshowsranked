            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1973 New York. The music industry at its peak: rock, punk, disco, hip-hop all fermenting. Richie Finestra is a record executive trying to save his company while destroying his life. Bobby Cannavale is Richie—coked, visionary, self-sabotaging. Martin Scorsese directs the pilot; Mick Jagger produces; Terence Winter writes. HBO poured resources into a show about music, money, and the price of both. Canceled after one season, but that season is glorious.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Bobby Cannavale is magnetic: the desperation, the addiction, the ear for talent that might destroy him. Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, Ray Romano provide the support structure. The casting captures 1970s music industry: the suits, the artists, the hangers-on. Performances without weak links.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1970s music industry rendered in obsessive detail: the labels, the radio stations, the clubs (CBGB, Studio 54), the money, the drugs. The show captures the era's transition: from rock to punk to disco to hip-hop. The world is specific and alive—one of television's best period pieces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Scorsese's pilot sets the tone: tracking shots through clubs, drug-fueled sequences, the violence of the industry rendered cinematically. The rest of the season maintains the quality. The 1970s are photographed as memory: golden, dangerous, excessive. Beautiful and grimy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is industry excess: parties, concerts, drug use, the machinery of fame. The music sequences—the New York Dolls, the proto-punk bands, the emerging hip-hop—are staged with period accuracy. The spectacle is authentic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Art vs. commerce, the industry that eats its own, the cost of having an ear for talent. Richie can hear the next big thing, but he can't keep his life together. The themes are familiar (music industry as beast), but rendered with commitment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Richie has to save American Century Records; he's trying to sell it to Polygram; he's trying to sign new acts; he's trying not to die from cocaine. The drive is constant—each episode has a crisis, a revelation, a set piece. The cancellation came despite the momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Canceled after one season. The show ends mid-story; Richie's fate is unresolved. HBO's cancellation remains controversial—one of the great one-season shows. The ending is incomplete, but the season is worth it anyway.</p>
