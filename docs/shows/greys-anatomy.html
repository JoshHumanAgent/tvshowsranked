<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Meredith Grey is an intern at Seattle Grace Hospital. Her mother was a legendary surgeon. Her love interest is her boss. Shonda Rhimes created the longest-running medical drama: doctors working, loving, dying, and monologuing. So many episodes. So much trauma.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3><p>Ellen Pompeo as Meredith: 20 seasons of growth. The rotating cast (Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Patrick Dempsey, etc.) created memorable characters who left or died. The show survives on character turnover.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>Seattle Grace (later Grey Sloan Memorial): the hospital, the residents, the attending physicians. The world is medical workplace drama.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>ABC medical drama: surgery scenes, romantic moments, disaster episodes. The style is network television—professional but not distinctive.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>Medical procedures, disaster episodes (plane crash, shooting, bomb). The spectacle is occasional—mostly interpersonal drama.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3><p>Love and work, trauma and recovery, the medical profession. The themes are explored through endless romantic entanglements.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Meredith's career and love life. The structure is medical drama—each episode has cases, relationships develop over seasons.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (3/10)</h3><p>20+ seasons, ongoing. No end in sight. The show has become a perpetual motion machine of medical drama.</p></div></section>
