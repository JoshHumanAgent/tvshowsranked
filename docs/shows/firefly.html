            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Space as frontier. A spaceship crew taking odd jobs at the edge of civilization, staying one step ahead of the law and the horrors they left behind. Nathan Fillion is Mal Reynolds, former soldier, current cynic, reluctant hero. Joss Whedon's cancelled-too-soon masterpiece: Western tropes in sci-fi setting, Chinese cursing, horses on spaceships, the Alliance as federal government, the Reavers as the frontier's dark heart. Fourteen episodes, a movie, and an eternal cult.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Nathan Fillion's Mal Reynolds defines the show: cranky, loyal, principled beneath the sarcasm. The ensemble—Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau—creates a complete family. Each character has distinct voice and history. Fourteen episodes aren't enough for all of them to develop fully, but the foundation is extraordinary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete universe in fourteen episodes: the Alliance's core worlds, the frontier planets, the Reavers on the edge, the history of the war, the economics of smuggling. The show establishes its world through action rather than exposition. The blend of Western and sci-fi is seamless—this is what frontier expansion looks like with FTL travel.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Early-2000s TV production: handheld cameras, visible budget limitations, but clear geography and coherent action. The space sequences are competent; the western sequences feel authentic to the genre. The style is functional, elevated by strong direction and editing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is limited by budget and era. Space battles, planetary landscapes, the occasional shootout—the show does what it can with what it has. The spectacle is in concept rather than execution: the idea of horses on a spaceship, the vision of frontier justice in the black.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The defeated soldier, the found family, the resistance to central authority. Firefly explores what happens after the losing side—how veterans live with defeat, how principles persist without institution. The show is anti-authoritarian without being simple; the Alliance isn't evil, just controlling. Themes of freedom, loyalty, survival.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic adventures with serialized elements: River's secret, the Alliance's pursuit, Shepherd Book's mysterious past. Each episode is complete, but the larger threat accumulates. The short season means no filler—every episode advances something. The drive is constant; the cancellation still hurts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Cancelled before completion. The movie Serenity provides some closure, but the television series ends mid-story. River's secrets are partially revealed; Book's backstory remains mysterious; the crew's future is uncertain. The ranking reflects what exists: fourteen perfect episodes, an incomplete arc. What might have been haunts what is.</p>
