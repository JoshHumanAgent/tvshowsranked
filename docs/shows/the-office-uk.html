            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Wernham Hogg paper company, Slough. David Brent is the manager who thinks he's a comedian, a philosopher, a friend to his staff. Tim Canterbury is the sales rep who knows this is hell. Dawn Tinsley is the receptionist who wants to be an illustrator. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant invented the mockumentary sitcom: cringe comedy, real emotion, no laugh track, no escape. The template for a decade of television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Ricky Gervais as David Brent created a character for the ages: desperate for love, incapable of earning it. Martin Freeman as Tim captures workplace despair and hope. Lucy Davis as Dawn is the heart. Mackenzie Crook as Gareth is the nemesis who becomes sympathetic. The performances set the template for mockumentary acting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Slough office: the desk arrangements, the break room, the car park, the Christmas party. The world is oppressively real—you've worked here. The mockumentary style makes everything feel captured, not performed. The world is mundane, and that's the genius.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The mockumentary style: handheld cameras, zooms, interviews to camera. The style was revolutionary—it made comedy feel real. The visual language is simple but invented a form. Everything since (Parks & Rec, Modern Family) builds on this.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is an office in Slough. The "spectacle" is David Brent dancing, or the Christmas special's emotional payoff. The aesthetic is anti-spectacle: this is life, unglamorous.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Workplace as prison, the need to be liked vs. the capacity to earn it, dreams deferred, whether we can change or just endure. The show is profound beneath its cringe. The Christmas special provides redemption without denying the pain that preceded it. Among comedy's most thoughtful works.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic awkwardness with serialized character development: Tim and Dawn's near-romance, Brent's decline. The Christmas specials provide the resolution the series set up. The drive is emotional—will these people escape?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons plus Christmas specials, complete. The Christmas special provides closure: Dawn escapes, Brent matures, Tim gets what he wanted. The ending is perfect. The show knew when to stop.</p>
