            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Thomas Cromwell rises from blacksmith's son to Henry VIII's most trusted advisor. He engineers the break with Rome, the dissolution of the monasteries, Anne Boleyn's fall. Mark Rylance is Cromwell: silent, watching, lethal. Hilary Mantel's novels adapted by Peter Straughan: Tudor politics as chess, power as survival.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Mark Rylance as Cromwell: one of television's great performances. Stillness as power, withholding as threat. Damian Lewis as Henry VIII: the king whose whims determine fates. Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn: the queen who overreaches. The ensemble is Shakespearean quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Tudor England: the court, the legal system, the religious houses, the European politics. The world is complete—Mantel's research translated to screen. Every detail is specific and authentic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>BBC prestige production: the court rendered with candlelit authenticity, the clothes perfect, the locations real. The style is observation—the camera watches Cromwell watch others. Period filmmaking at its finest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the court, the ceremonies, the executions. The spectacle serves the history—not battlefields but council chambers. The spectacle is watching power operate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Power, survival, the cost of competence, what we owe to our pasts, the religious reformation as political necessity. The show explores Tudor politics with Mantel's depth. Dense and rewarding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Cromwell must navigate Henry's desires, Anne's ambition, the Pope's refusal, the nobles' contempt. The drive is political survival—each decision has consequences. The pacing is deliberate but propulsive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 covers Cromwell's rise and Anne's fall. Season 2 (2024) covers the end of his life. The ending is historical—Cromwell's fall is known. The drama is in the how, not the what. Masterful.</p>
