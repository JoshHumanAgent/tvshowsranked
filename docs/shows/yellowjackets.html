            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1996: A girls' soccer team's plane crashes in the wilderness. They survive for nineteen months. Something happened out there—rituals, darkness, sacrifice. Present day: The survivors are adults with secrets, being blackmailed by someone who knows what they did. Dual timelines: the wilderness desperation and the present-day unraveling. Lord of the Flies with teenage girls, plus cult mystery plus adult trauma. What happened in the woods? Who's watching now?
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Dual casts create a single ensemble: Melanie Lynskey and Sophie Nélisse as Shauna, Tawny Cypress and Jasmin Savoy Brown as Taissa, Christina Ricci and Sammi Hanratty as Misty. The casting is precise—adults who embody teenage trauma. The performances capture survivors' damage: addiction, paranoia, compartmentalization. Misty is television's most unsettling character.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Two worlds: the wilderness and the present. The wilderness is rendered with brutal specificity: winter starvation, cabin fever, the shift from team to tribe. The present is suburbs, careers, the masks adulthood provides. The two worlds illuminate each other—what happened then shapes what's breaking now.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The wilderness is cold, gray, desperate; the present is warm, controlled, brittle. The visual distinction between timelines is clear without being heavy-handed. The horror sequences are staged with restraint—suggestion over gore. The show knows what to show and what to withhold.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The crash, the winter, the rituals glimpsed. The show stages horror effectively—the blood, the symbols, the moments of violence. But spectacle isn't the point: psychological damage is. The "spectacle" is watching adult survivors crumble.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Trauma as inheritance, the violence beneath civilization, female adolescence as horror story. The show explores what survival costs: who you become when society's rules dissolve. The cult elements suggest supernatural force or mass psychosis—either reading works. Rich with interpretation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Dual timelines create dual momentum: what happened in the wilderness, and who's threatening the survivors now? Each episode reveals pieces of both puzzles. The structure maintains tension across timelines—cliffhangers in one era echo into the other. Addictive television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The mystery continues to expand: what exactly happened out there? Is there something supernatural? The show risks Lost syndrome—more questions than answers. The third season will determine whether this is controlled storytelling or mystery-box accumulation. Premise excellent; ending unproven.</p>
