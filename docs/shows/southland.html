            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Los Angeles. The cops patrol neighborhoods of extreme wealth and extreme poverty. Officer John Cooper trains rookie Ben Sherman while struggling with addiction. Detective Sammy Bryant navigates gang enforcement and personal chaos. The camera follows handheld, documentary-style. No music cues, no resolutions, just the shift. Ann Biderman created the most realistic police show on television—gritty, compassionate, uncompromising.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Michael Cudlitz as Cooper is the soul of the show: a good cop destroying himself, training rookies with compassion and rage. Benjamin McKenzie, Shawn Hatosy, Regina King—the ensemble captures the LAPD with authenticity. The performances are raw, unglamorous, real.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Los Angeles: the neighborhoods, the gangs, the homeless camps, the mansions, the endless sprawl. The world is rendered with documentary fidelity—this is where cops actually work, who they actually encounter. The geography is specific; the social layers are visible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Handheld, documentary-style: the camera follows the cops into houses, onto crime scenes, through chases. No score—ambient sound only. The style was innovative; many shows copied it. The authenticity is the aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is police work: traffic stops, domestic disputes, crime scenes. The "spectacle" is the realism—watching actual police work rather than TV police work. Budget went to authenticity, not effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Policing, trauma, addiction, the thin line between law and crime, the impossibility of remaining unscarred. The show explores what the job does to people—the suicide rate, the divorce rate, the bottle. Complex without being didactic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic calls with serialized character arcs. Each shift brings new incidents; each season develops the cops' personal lives. The drive is accumulation—the weight of what they see. Not traditional cliffhangers; just the ongoing burden.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons, cancelled without proper ending. Cooper's arc was building toward tragedy; the show stopped before arrival. What exists is among TV's best police drama; the absence of resolution is felt.</p>
