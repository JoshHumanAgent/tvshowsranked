            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Baltimore. The Gun Trace Task Force—elite police unit—robbing citizens, dealing drugs, selling guns to criminals, operating with impunity because they were the law. Jon Bernthal is Sgt. Wayne Jenkins, the charismatic monster at the center. David Simon returns to Baltimore post-The Wire, but this isn't fiction: every abuse happened, every corruption is documented. The system creating the monsters it claims to fight, police reform as oxymoron, a city that learned nothing from The Wire because The Wire was never a lesson—it was a diagnosis.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jon Bernthal's Wayne Jenkins is terrifying—the bravado, the certainty, the complete absence of conscience. Wunmi Mosaku as the investigator brings moral clarity. Jamie Hector, Josh Charles, and Treat Williams provide dimension. The performances avoid caricature even when depicting caricatures of police work. Real people, rendered recognizable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Baltimore as Simon knows it: the corners, the districts, the city hall negotiations, the federal investigations. The procedural detail is educational—how consent decrees work, why reform fails, what "community policing" means. Simon's journalism background creates complete, accurate systems. The world is horrifying precisely because it's documented.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Simon's established visual style: functional, documentary-adjacent, unobtrusive. The camera observes without beautifying. Baltimore looks like itself—not TV Baltimore, actual Baltimore. The aesthetic serves journalism rather than art.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is procedural horror: watching crimes committed by badge-wearers, watching systems protect abusers, watching a city fail its citizens repeatedly. The power is in the documentation, not the presentation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Policing in America as unfixable. The show explores the failure of every reform: body cameras, consent decrees, community oversight. The argument is structural—when police are revenue collectors and warriors rather than protectors, corruption isn't bug but feature. Simon's most despairing work, which is saying something. Essential viewing for understanding American policing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Six episodes, multiple timelines: the crimes, the investigation, the federal case. The structure fragments chronology to show patterns—this wasn't one bad apple, this was the barrel. The pacing is deliberate; some viewers will find it slow. Those who appreciate systemic critique will find it compelling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries. Jenkins is caught; some officers cooperate; some face consequences. But the show's point is that nothing changes—GTTF was one unit in one city in a nation of similar stories. The ending is resolution without hope, accurate to its subject.</p>
