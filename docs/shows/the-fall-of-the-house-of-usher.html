            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Roderick Usher's children are dying. One by one, grotesquely, as a mysterious woman from his past watches. Mike Flanagan adapts Edgar Allan Poe across the Usher family: each child's death references a different Poe story. Bruce Greenwood is Roderick; Carla Gugino is the woman. Horror as family tragedy, capitalism as curse.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Bruce Greenwood as Roderick Usher: the patriarch whose empire was built on blood. Carla Gugino as Verna: the supernatural force. The children (Mary McDonnell, Henry Thomas, Samantha Sloyan, Rahul Kohli, Kate Siegel) each get their moment. Flanagan's ensemble delivers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The Usher empire: pharmaceutical wealth, corrupt institutions, a family built on exploitation. The world is the opioid crisis as Gothic horror—the Sacklers by way of Poe. The mansion, the boardrooms, the graves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Mike Flanagan's visual style: long takes, atmospheric lighting, the Gothic rendered modern. The deaths are staged with horrific creativity—each Poe reference visualized. The style is the substance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is horror: grotesque deaths, supernatural visions, the past returning. Each episode features a signature death sequence. The gore is artistic, the horror is thematic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Capitalism as horror, inherited sin, whether empire is worth the cost, the opioid epidemic as American Gothic. The show explores exploitation through supernatural revenge. Poe's themes expanded to corporate critique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The children die one by one. Each episode reveals past sins and present consequences. The structure is countdown—who's next, how will they die, what does Verna want? The pacing is relentless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The past is revealed, the debts are paid, the house falls. The ending references Poe's story while concluding Flanagan's thematic exploration. Perfect.</p>
