            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A hotel in Seoul that caters to ghosts. Jang Man-wol (IU) is the beautiful, ancient owner cursed to run the hotel until she finds redemption. Gu Chan-sung (Yeo Jin-goo) is the human manager she hired, a hotelier who can see the dead. Each episode features a ghost with unfinished business; the serialized arc follows Man-wol's curse and Chan-sung's growing attachment. K-drama fantasy with style, tears, and a heroine who's been dead inside for a thousand years.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>IU (Lee Ji-eun) creates an iconic character: Man-wol is bitter, materialistic, secretly kind, and trapped by a crime she committed a millennium ago. Her transformation across 16 episodes is K-drama magic. Yeo Jin-goo's Chan-sung provides the moral center. The ghost guests (a new one each episode) provide emotional variety. IU's performance is the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The Hotel del Luna exists between worlds: ghosts check out to the afterlife, but some aren't ready. The hotel is gorgeous, haunted, full of secrets. The rules (ghosts can't harm humans, the moon staff, the bridge to the afterlife) are established and maintained. The world is complete and consistent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>K-drama production at its peak: the hotel is sumptuous, the ghost effects are seamless, Seoul at night is photographed beautifully. The visual style shifts between hotel luxury and ghostly danger without jarring. The palette supports the mood—warm for Chan-sung, cold for Man-wol's past.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The hotel itself is spectacle: the lobby, the rooms, the bridge to the afterlife, the moon that Man-wol stares at. Ghost effects are handled well—this is fantasy, not horror. The spectacle is romantic-gothic, consistent with K-drama aesthetics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ghosts with unfinished business, curses born from guilt, redemption through letting go. Each guest ghost has a story about attachment—why they can't move on. Man-wol's curse is the throughline: she killed the one she loved, and she's been frozen ever since. The themes are handled with K-drama warmth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic ghosts with serialized arc: each episode has a guest story while Man-wol's curse develops. The structure is classic K-drama—emotional episodes building to final resolution. The pacing is propulsive across 16 episodes; the tears are earned.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete story in 16 episodes. Man-wol's curse is resolved; her journey is complete; the ending is devastating and beautiful. K-drama at its finest: a complete arc with a satisfying conclusion. No second season needed.</p>
