            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Christopher Pike commands the USS Enterprise before Kirk. Spock is his science officer. Uhura is a cadet. The show returns to Trek's original format: episodic adventures, moral dilemmas, optimism. Anson Mount is Pike: the captain who knows his future but leads anyway. Classic Trek for the streaming era.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Anson Mount's Pike is among Trek's best captains: warm, authoritative, human. Ethan Peck as Spock honors Nimoy while making the role his own. Rebecca Romijn as Number One, Celia Rose Gooding as Uhura, Babs Olusanmokun as M'Benga—the ensemble captures the Trek spirit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The Federation, the Enterprise, the final frontier: the show returns to Gene Roddenberry's vision with modern production. The worlds visited each episode feel distinct. The optimistic future is restored.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Paramount+ production: the Enterprise rendered with detail, alien worlds designed with care, space photographed beautifully. The style honors the original while updating the effects. Classic Trek aesthetics, modern budget.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Alien planets, space battles, new civilizations. The spectacle is classic Trek: the ship, the shuttles, the strange new worlds. Each episode delivers visual wonder alongside moral questions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Pike's foreknowledge of his death, Spock's human-Vulcan dual nature, the Prime Directive, diplomacy vs. intervention. The show explores classic Trek themes: optimism, moral complexity, the better angels of our nature.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic adventures with serialized character development. Each episode is a complete story—the format fans wanted. The Pike arc (knowing his future) provides ongoing tension. The drive is exploration itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Three seasons completed or in production. The show knows its endpoint (Pike's fate is established in Trek canon) but hasn't reached it. Currently successful and acclaimed.</p>
