            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">Shanty Town is a Nigerian crime drama that plunges into Lagos's underground—a world of gangsters, corrupt politicians, and women caught in systems of exploitation. The series follows multiple characters whose lives intersect through violence and survival: a fixer looking for a way out, prostitutes planning escape, a politician whose ambitions require dirty work, and the gang leader who controls all of it. It's a familiar crime-drama structure executed with local specificity that makes it feel fresh.</p>

            <p>The show's strongest asset is its setting. Lagos comes alive not as exotic backdrop but as a character with its own rules and rhythms. The shanty town itself—the cramped spaces, the precarious economics, the social networks that sustain and trap people—is rendered with eye for detail that suggests lived experience rather than research. The production design communicates poverty and density without tourism, showing why people stay even when they dream of leaving.</p>

            <p>Where Shanty Town struggles is in balancing its multiple storylines within six episodes. Characters are introduced and dispatched with a speed that doesn't allow for development, and some arcs feel truncated by the constraint of the limited series format. The violence is frequent and explicit, which serves the show's themes but can feel relentless. What distinguishes it from countless other crime dramas is the Nigerian context—the particular forms that corruption takes, the role of traditional authority alongside modern power, the women whose options are constrained in ways that the show treats seriously rather than exploitatively.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>Shanty Town earns its position through atmosphere and specificity rather than narrative innovation. It's a competent crime thriller elevated by its setting and the freshness of Nigerian cinema for international audiences. The score reflects solid execution within a familiar genre framework.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The cast conveys the hardness required by the material without losing humanity. The gang leader is genuinely menacing without becoming cartoonish; the women attempting escape have agency despite their constrained circumstances. The performances are physical in a way that matches the environment—bodies that have survived, faces that have seen too much. Chidi Mokeme as Scar is particularly effective, communicating threat through stillness.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Lagos's criminal underworld is rendered with specificity that suggests authenticity. The relationship between street-level operations and political power feels true to the Nigerian context, where these worlds overlap rather than remain separate. The shanty town itself is a fully realized environment—claustrophobic, dangerous, but also home to the people who live there.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual style leans into darkness—many scenes are lit by single sources, creating deep shadows that match the moral terrain. The camera moves through crowded spaces with the density of real Lagos streets. There's an effective contrast between the gritty shanty town and the cleaner spaces of political power, highlighting class division visually.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle here is violence—shootouts, beatings, scenes of exploitation rendered unsparingly. It's not action cinema; the violence is ugly rather than thrilling, which is appropriate to the material but limits the visual pleasure. The production design of the shanty town itself provides the primary visual interest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages with systems of exploitation—the way poverty creates vulnerability, how power protects itself, the limited options available to women in particular circumstances. These themes are present but not explored with depth; the narrative momentum doesn't pause for analysis. The Nigerian setting adds specificity but doesn't change the underlying crime-drama framework.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Multiple storylines converge over six episodes with efficiency. The limited episode count forces focus—there's no room for filler. Each episode advances at least one character arc toward its destination. The momentum is sometimes too aggressive, sacrificing character development for plot progression.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The finale resolves some arcs definitively while leaving others open, suggesting either sequel ambitions or narrative uncertainty. The deaths feel earned, the escapes feel possible, the political machinations feel ongoing. It's a conclusion that satisfies without completing, which fits the show's themes about systems that persist beyond individual stories.</p>
