## What It Feels Like to Watch

Halt and Catch Fire is a show about the people who built the computer revolution—but it's really about ambition, creativity, and the cost of chasing dreams.

Set in the 1980s and 1990s, it follows a group of visionaries who see the future before anyone else. There's Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), a brilliant programmer who refuses to compromise. Her ex-husband Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), an engineer with ideas bigger than his abilities. Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a charismatic hustler who pushes them all. And Donna Clark (Alison Pill), Gordon's wife, who becomes a force in her own right.

The first season is slow. The show doesn't find its voice immediately. But stick with it. By season two, it's one of the best dramas on television. By season three, it's transcendent.

What makes Halt and Catch Fire special is its emotional honesty. It's a show about people who want to change the world but destroy themselves in the process. The relationships are messy. The ambitions conflict. And the computers—those are characters too.

The production captures the era perfectly. The bulky monitors, the chunky keyboards, the sound of dial-up modems. It feels authentic.

Four seasons cover the rise of the PC, the birth of graphical interfaces, and the early web. It's a story we've never seen told before—about the humans behind the machines that changed everything.
