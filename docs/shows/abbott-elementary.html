<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Janine Teagues teaches at Abbott Elementary, an underfunded Philadelphia public school. She's optimistic; the system is not. Quinta Brunson created the warm workplace comedy: teachers doing their best, documentary crew capturing the chaos.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Quinta Brunson as Janine: optimism personified. Janelle James as Ava: the terrible principal. Tyler James Williams as Gregory. Sheryl Lee Ralph as Barbara: the veteran teacher. The ensemble feels real.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Abbott Elementary: the classroom, the hallway, the teachers' lounge, the underfunding. The world is public education rendered with love.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>ABC mockumentary: the office, the school, the visual language of workplace comedy. Warm and functional.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (1/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is a school with broken AC. The "spectacle" is watching teachers care.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Public education, teacher dedication, systemic underfunding, workplace found family. The show explores these with warmth.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Janine's growth as teacher; workplace dynamics. The structure is workplace comedy with heart.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (4/10)</h3><p>Ongoing. Three seasons building. No end in sight—sitcom perpetual motion.</p></div></section>
