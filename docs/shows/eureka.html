            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Eureka is a town in the Pacific Northwest where the government sent its smartest scientists. They work on classified projects; things regularly go wrong. Jack Carter is the sheriff—not a genius, but everyone else's common sense proxy. The show is Northern Exposure with mad science: a town of brilliant misfits, weekly disasters, and the regular guy who keeps them alive.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Colin Ferguson as Jack Carter is the audience surrogate and the heart: smart enough, decent, perpetually confused. The ensemble (Salli Richardson-Whitfield, Joe Morton, Jordan Hinson) creates the town of geniuses. The performances are light and functional—the show is comfort television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Eureka: the town, Global Dynamics (the research facility), the homes, the cafe, the school for genius children. The world is specific and consistent—the science is fantastical, but the town dynamics are real. Each scientist has a specialty; each episode features a new invention gone wrong.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Syfy production: the town looks pleasant, the science looks expensive enough, the effects are TV-budget but sufficient. The style serves the premise without distinguishing. Comfort television aesthetics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is science gone wrong: time loops, artificial suns, nanobots, parallel dimensions. The effects are TV-budget but creative. The spectacle serves the weekly problem-solving.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Science vs. common sense, the responsibility of genius, government secrets, the ethics of invention. The themes are present but light—the show prioritizes entertainment over exploration. Fun without depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic problems with serialized development: the town faces a weekly crisis, Jack solves it with common sense, relationships develop. The structure is classic TV comfort—each problem solved, each episode complete.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with conclusion. The finale resolves the timeline and the romantic arcs. The show was cancelled then briefly revived; the ending was produced. Complete and satisfying for fans.</p>
