## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Plot Against America is a chilling alternate history based on Philip Roth's novel. It imagines a world where Charles Lindbergh—famous aviator and Nazi sympathizer—defeats Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election.

You watch The Plot Against America and feel the creeping dread. This isn't a fantastical alternate reality—it's plausible, grounded, and terrifying. The series follows a Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey, as America transforms into something unrecognizable.

David Simon and Ed Burns bring their signature realism to the material. The everyday details make the horror more disturbing. This could happen. That's what haunts you.

The series explores how ordinary people respond to extraordinary threats. Some resist. Some adapt. Some collaborate. No one emerges unchanged.
