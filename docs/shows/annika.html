            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                DI Annika Strandhed leads the Marine Homicide Unit in Glasgow. She's brilliant, she's difficult, she breaks the fourth wall to talk to the audience. Her daughter is struggling, her team is adjusting, and the Scottish waterways keep producing bodies. Nicola Walker is Annika—droll, efficient, hiding vulnerability beneath competence. Scottish crime with a distinctive voice.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Nicola Walker is the show: the fourth-wall breaks, the mordant humor, the competence that masks personal chaos. Jamie Sives, Katie Leung, and Ukweli Roach provide the team. The daughter (Silvie Furneaux) creates the personal stakes. Walker's performance elevates standard crime procedural.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Glasgow and the Scottish waterways: the marine unit, the police hierarchy, the city's harbor culture. The world is specific—this is not generic UK crime drama, but Scottish crime with marine focus. The setting distinguishes the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Scottish crime-drama aesthetics: Glasgow photographed with appropriately grey atmosphere, the water always present. The style is functional—this is performance-driven television, not visual art.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the water: bodies pulled from the Clyde, boats, harbors. Crime procedural spectacle—crime scenes, investigations, interrogations. This is character-driven, not visual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Work-life balance, single parenting while professional, the burden of competence. Annika breaks the fourth wall to share her internal monologue—this is her therapy. The themes are present in the format.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic crimes with serialized personal development: each episode has a case, the season develops Annika's family life and team dynamics. The fourth-wall breaks provide momentum—we want to hear what Annika thinks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues to develop Annika's life and cases. No clear endpoint; British crime procedural structure allows indefinite continuation.</p>
