<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Kim Deuk-pal is a 47-year-old gangster in 1993. After a job gone wrong, he wakes up in a hospital—in the body of a high school student. He uses his gangster skills and adult wisdom to navigate the brutal hierarchy of Korean high school. High School Return of a Gangster is body swap comedy with violence: a middle-aged criminal tries to survive teenage politics, romance, and exams. The show is surprisingly emotional—Deuk-pal discovers what he missed by choosing crime, and the kid whose body he took was bullied and broken. It's violent, funny, and moving in ways that shouldn't work together. The fantasy premise allows for redemption that feels earned.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3><p>Yoon Chan-young plays the adult in teen body perfectly—the gangster mannerisms in high school. The supporting bullies are realistic, the bullied kid before the swap is heartbreaking. The school hierarchy is recognizable but extreme.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>1993 Korean gangster underworld: money lending, violence, survival. Modernizing to 2023 high school creates comedy and friction. The school hierarchy is universal—bullying, popularity, romance.</p></div>

<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3><p>Surviving high school, confronting bullies, discovering the body's original trauma, escaping gangster past. The dual plotlines pull forward—past and present both active.</p></div>
