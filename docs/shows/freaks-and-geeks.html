            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                William McKinley High School, 1980. Lindsay Weir is drifting from mathlete to burnout; her brother Sam is navigating the bottom of the social hierarchy with his geek friends. Paul Feig created, Judd Apatow produced, a generation of future stars launched (James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Linda Cardellini). Eighteen episodes before cancellation, but every one of them captured high school's particular misery: the cruelty, the yearning, the desperate attempts to fit in. No show before or since has been this honest about being a teenager.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The casting is legendary: Linda Cardellini as Lindsay, caught between worlds; John Francis Daley as Sam, whose earnestness creates pain and comedy; James Franco as Daniel, the burnout with depth; Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Busy Philipps, Martin Starr—so many careers launched here. The performances avoid caricature; every character has dimension.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>1980 Michigan high school as complete ecosystem: the cafeteria hierarchies, the jock privilege, the freak corner, the AV club, the basement where geeks play Dungeons & Dragons. The world is specific, time-accurate, emotionally universal. Anyone who went to high school will recognize this place.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>1999 network television: functional, dated, unpretentious. The visual style doesn't distinguish; the writing and acting do. The period detail is accurate without being fetishized. The look serves the story.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is high school: hallways, basements, keg parties, cafeterias. The "spectacle" is emotional—the humiliations, the triumphs, the moments of connection that feel like salvation. Television as empathy machine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Adolescence as horror and comedy intertwined. The show explores identity formation, social hierarchy, parental disappointment, the desperate need to belong. It refuses easy answers—Lindsay's drift toward the freaks isn't celebrated or condemned, just portrayed. The geeks' struggles aren't triumphant, just true.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic stories with serialized character development. Each episode is a complete experience; the season tracks Lindsay's transformation and Sam's navigation. The drive is emotional rather than plot-driven—will Lindsay find her place? Will Sam survive? Episodes stand alone; the whole deepens.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Eighteen episodes, cancelled before completion, but the finale works. Lindsay leaves for the Dead tour, abandoning her academic future for the Grateful Dead. Sam chooses D&D over popularity. The ending respects the show's themes: growth isn't always linear, belonging isn't always healthy. Perfect conclusion despite cancellation.</p>
