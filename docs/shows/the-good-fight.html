            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Alicia Florrick's story ended. Diane Lockhart's continues. A Ponzi scheme destroys her savings; she joins a predominantly African-American law firm. Christine Baranski leads a spinoff that became more politically engaged than The Good Wife: Trump, fake news, cancel culture, the surveillance state. The Kings' legal drama evolved into political commentary.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Christine Baranski is magnificent: Diane's dignity, her political rage, her determination. Cush Jumbo, Rose Leslie, Delroy Lindo, Audra McDonald—the ensemble matches The Good Wife's quality. The performances tackle material that network television wouldn't touch.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Chicago law, expanded: Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart, the courts, the politics, the media landscape. The world incorporates contemporary issues—every episode engages with current events. The firm is distinct from The Good Wife's; the concerns are contemporary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Streaming production values: higher budget than network, cinematic touches in opening sequences, the visual language of prestige drama. The style serves the content without overwhelming it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is law: courtrooms, depositions, media appearances. The "spectacle" is intellectual—watching the Kings engage with contemporary politics through legal drama.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3>
                <p>The Trump presidency, fake news, cancel culture, racial dynamics in progressive spaces, the rule of law under threat. The show engages directly with politics The Good Wife avoided. The density is the point—this is television about now.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Case-of-the-week with serialized arcs, like The Good Wife. But the serialized material is more aggressive: Diane's political despair, the firm's survival, the surveillance state. The drive is constant; the engagement is contemporary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Six seasons with conclusion. The show ended on its own terms, with Diane and the firm in a changed world. The finale provided resolution while acknowledging the ongoing political situation. Complete and appropriate.</p>
