            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Sherlock Holmes in contemporary London. Texting instead of telegrams, nicotine patches instead of pipes, consulting detective as profession. Benedict Cumberbatch is the sociopath we can't look away from; Martin Freeman is the moral center we need. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss update Conan Doyle with reverence and invention—each episode a feature-length puzzle box. The first three seasons were lightning: sharp, confident, revolutionary. Then it got pleased with itself.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Cumberbatch's Sherlock is iconic: the speed, the disdain, the occasional flashes of something almost human. Freeman's Watson is the necessary anchor—wounded, loyal, the window through which we view genius. Andrew Scott's Moriarty is chaos incarnate. The supporting cast—Una Stubbs, Rupert Graves, Louise Brealey—provides dimension. The chemistry between the leads defines the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Modern London as playground: Baker Street, the Diogenes Club, the British government's surveillance apparatus. The show creates a credible world where a consulting detective might exist—police who tolerate him, criminals who challenge him, a brother who controls him. The world is sufficient, though secondary to the puzzles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Visual storytelling as deduction: text messages floating on screen, thought processes rendered visible, timelines compressed into split-seconds. The technique was revolutionary when introduced; it influenced everything after. The cinematography makes thinking cinematic—watching someone reason becomes as dramatic as watching them fight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is intellectual: deductions that feel like magic, puzzles solved at speed. The production is BBC-budget elevated—London looks good, the Baker Street flat is perfect. Action sequences are staged competently. The spectacle serves the story rather than overwhelming it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Updating Holmes to the present raises questions: what does genius look like in an information age? What does friendship mean when one party can't reciprocate emotion? The show explores these without belaboring. The cases are variations on Conan Doyle; the innovation is context, not concept.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Seasons 1-3 are propulsive: each 90-minute episode is a complete mystery with serialized character development. The cliffhangers are legendary—Sherlock's death, his return, the apparent return of Moriarty. The drive is constant. Seasons 4 (excluded from this ranking) lost momentum; the first three seasons maintain it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Seasons 1-3 tell a complete arc: meeting, partnering, apparent death, return. But the show continued into season 4, which many consider a decline. The exclusion of season 4 protects the ranking—this is Sherlock at its peak, before self-indulgence overwhelmed invention. Incomplete ending, but quality maintained.</p>
