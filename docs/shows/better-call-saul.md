## What It Feels Like to Watch

When Better Call Saul was announced, many wondered: do we really need Saul Goodman's backstory? Six seasons later, the question answers itself. This isn't just a prequel—it's a meditation on identity, morality, and the stories we tell ourselves.

You meet Jimmy McGill, a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque who can't catch a break. He's not a criminal yet—he's just someone who cuts corners, who sees the angles, who wants to be loved. Over six seasons, you watch him become Saul Goodman, and it's heartbreaking. You understand every step. You see the wounds that drive him. You recognize the choices he could have made but didn't.

Bob Odenkirk is extraordinary. He makes you care about someone who, in Breaking Bad, was comic relief. His Jimmy is wounded, ambitious, self-sabotaging, and strangely sympathetic. The relationship between Jimmy and Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) is one of television's great romances—not because of passion, but because of mutual understanding and mutual destruction.

Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut provides the anchor. You've seen him in Breaking Bad, but here you see how he became who he was. His quiet grief, his code, his compromises—all given weight and history.

The visual language is stunning. The color palette shifts as Jimmy transforms. The cold blues of the early seasons warm into the neon of the Saul Goodman era. Every frame is composed with purpose.

Better Call Saul takes its time. It asks you to be patient. But if you give it that patience, it rewards you with a conclusion that rivals anything in television. It's proof that sometimes the journey to a destination is more interesting than the destination itself.
