## What It Feels Like to Watch

When Better Call Saul was announced, many wondered: do we really need Saul Goodman's backstory? Six seasons later, the question answers itself. This isn't just a prequel—it's a meditation on identity, morality, and the stories we tell ourselves.

You meet Jimmy McGill, a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque who can't catch a break. He's not a criminal yet—he's just someone who cuts corners, who sees the angles, who wants to be loved. Over six seasons, you watch him become Saul Goodman, and it's heartbreaking. You understand every step. You see the wounds that drive him. You recognize the choices he could have made but didn't.

Bob Odenkirk is extraordinary. He makes you care about someone who, in Breaking Bad, was comic relief. His Jimmy is wounded, ambitious, self-sabotaging, and strangely sympathetic. The relationship between Jimmy and Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) is one of television's great romances—not because of passion, but because of mutual understanding and mutual destruction.

Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut provides the anchor. You've seen him in Breaking Bad, but here you see how he became who he was. His quiet grief, his code, his compromises—all given weight and history.

The visual language is stunning. The color palette shifts as Jimmy transforms. The cold blues of the early seasons warm into the neon of the Saul Goodman era. Every frame is composed with purpose.

Better Call Saul takes its time. It asks you to be patient. But if you give it that patience, it rewards you with a conclusion that rivals anything in television. It's proof that sometimes the journey to a destination is more interesting than the destination itself.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 10.0

**Raw Score: 10.0 | Weighted: 2.00**

**Strengths:**
- **Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk)**: A masterclass in transformation. Odenkirk carries the show across six seasons, making you sympathize with someone who becomes a criminal. His range—from comically desperate to devastatingly vulnerable—is extraordinary.
- **Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn)**: A revelation. Seehorn transforms from supporting player to co-protagonist. Her arc—from idealist to compromised to destroyed—is heartbreaking. Her final scene is career-defining.
- **Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks)**: You've seen this character in Breaking Bad, but Banks gives him new depth. His grief, his code, his compromises—all explored. Banks brings quiet intensity to every scene.
- **Chuck McGill (Michael McKean)**: The antagonist who's also a victim. McKean's performance as Jimmy's brother is nuanced and tragic. Their relationship is the heart of the show.
- **Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian)**: A surprising villain/victim. Fabian makes Howard both odious and pitiable.
- **Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito)**: Returning from Breaking Bad, Esposito elevates every scene. His cold, calculating presence is terrifying.

**Weaknesses:**
- Some supporting characters (the cousins, Huell) feel underutilized.
- Lalo Salamanca is memorable but slightly over-the-top compared to the show's restraint.

**Why 10.0**: Jimmy and Kim are among the best characters ever created. The supporting cast is equally brilliant.

---

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.275**

**Strengths:**
- **Albuquerque**: Continues Breaking Bad's setting, expanding it. The law offices, the courts, the sandpiper retirement home—all feel real.
- **Legal world**: Shows the mechanics of being a lawyer— courtroom procedures, paralegals, client relationships.
- **Criminal ecosystem**: The cartel, the Salamancas, Mike's private investigation work—all detailed.
- **The nail salon**: An inspired choice for money laundering—boring on purpose.
- **Dual worlds**: Jimmy's legitimate legal world and his criminal world intersect and collide.

**Weaknesses:**
- Doesn't expand as much beyond Breaking Bad's world as expected.
- The nail salon storyline goes nowhere.

**Why 8.5**: Excellent continuation of an established world, but not quite the expansion hoped for.

---

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 0.95**

**Strengths:**
- **Color coding**: The blue/cold of Jimmy's early days vs. the warmer/neon of Saul. Visual storytelling.
- **Tracking shots**: Long takes following Jimmy through hallways, courts, deserts.
- **Montage sequences**: The "Kettleman's Insurance" song, Jimmy's billboard work—cinematic brilliance.
- **Wide shots**: Albuquerque's landscape used to frame emotional states.
- **Tight close-ups**: Faces in crucial moments.

**Weaknesses:**
- Occasionally too similar to Breaking Bad's visual language.
- Some late-season episodes lack early seasons' visual ambition.

**Why 9.5**: Consistently beautiful, often surpassing its predecessor in visual poetry.

---

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 0.75**

**Strengths:**
- **Desert vastness**: The New Mexico landscape is always present.
- **Explosive moments**: Lalo's attack, the desert confrontation, the break-in—these have impact.
- **Gene/CSI montage**: The black-and-white crime-scene cleaning sequences are visually striking.

**Weaknesses:**
- Not a spectacle show. The violence is restrained.
- No car chases, no gunfights on the scale of Breaking Bad.
- The Salamancas bring more menace than action.

**Why 7.5**: Effective when needed, but spectacle isn't the point.

---

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 1.425**

**Strengths:**
- **Identity**: Who are we? Jimmy McGill, Saul Goodman, Gene Takavic—the show explores how we construct and abandon identities.
- **Morality**: Every character compromises. The show asks: is there a point of no return?
- **Law vs. justice**: The legal system is shown as obstacle, not tool.
- **Code**: Mike has one. Jimmy develops one. Gus has one. What do we live by?
- **Siblings**: The Jimmy/Chuck relationship is a profound exploration of family.
- **Romance**: Jimmy/Kim is the show's heart—not passion, but understanding.

**Weaknesses:**
- Season 6's Gene storyline, while thematically complete, feels like a different show.
- Some philosophical moments feel slightly forced.

**Why 9.5**: As thematically rich as Breaking Bad, sometimes more so.

---

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 9.0

**Raw Score: 9.0 | Weighted: 1.35**

**Strengths:**
- **Patient storytelling**: The show takes its time, trusting the audience.
- **Build to payoff**: Every scene builds to something. The snail, the mesa, the piano—all pay off.
- **Dual timelines**: The flash-forwards add tension.
- **Breaking Bad connections**: Each callback rewards dedicated viewers.
- **Ocb ourse escalation**: Each season raises the stakes.

**Weaknesses:**
- The pace can be glacial. Not for everyone.
- Season 5's delay of Lalo's fate tested patience.
- The Gene finale divided fans.

**Why 9.0**: Masterful storytelling that rewards patience, though not as propulsive as its predecessor.

---

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 9.5

**Raw Score: 9.5 | Weighted: 1.425**

**Strengths:**
- **Series finale "Saul Gone"**: A perfect conclusion. Every version of Jimmy is acknowledged.
- **Jimmy's choice**: He confesses, returns to his name, accepts consequences. Heroic in its own way.
- **Kim's scene**: Her final visit to Jimmy in prison—the show's emotional peak.
- **Mike's ending**: "I gave you my answer." Fitting.
- **No loose threads**: Everything resolves.

**Weaknesses:**
- Gene/CSI storyline feels slightly rushed.
- Some fans wanted different endings for certain characters.

**Why 9.5**: Nearly perfect. A fitting conclusion to an extraordinary journey.
