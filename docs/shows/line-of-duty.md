## What It Feels Like to Watch

In the UK, there's a unit called AC-12. Their job: investigate police officers who might be corrupt. *Line of Duty* follows their investigations — and the labyrinthine conspiracies they uncover.

Jed Mercurio created this British phenomenon, and it's become one of the most-watched BBC dramas ever. The formula is addictive: each season introduces a new investigation, a new suspect, and a new set of morally ambiguous characters. At the center is the mysterious "H" — a senior officer at the heart of a massive conspiracy that spans seasons.

The cast is excellent: Martin Compston as DI Steve Arnott, a principled detective who transferred to AC-12 after a controversial shooting; Vicky McClured as DI Kate Fleming, an undercover operative with complicated loyalties; and the legendary performance by Martin Shaw as DCS Ted Hastings, the unit's leader.

The show is famous for its interrogation scenes — long, intense conversations where suspects are interviewed and the truth slowly emerges. These scenes are gripping, full of chess-like maneuvering. It also features some of the most shocking deaths in British television history.

The show isn't perfect: the final season divided opinion, and some plotlines went nowhere. But the journey was extraordinary.
