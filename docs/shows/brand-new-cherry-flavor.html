            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Lisa Nova comes to 1990s Hollywood to direct a horror film. A producer betrays her. She seeks revenge through occult means. The curse spirals out of control. Rosa Salazar is Lisa in the adaptation of Todd Grimson's novel: Hollywood as nightmare, revenge as body horror, surreal LA noir.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Rosa Salazar as Lisa: the aspiring director, the wounded woman, the revenge-seeker. Catherine Keener as the occultist who helps her. The performances embrace the surreal. Salazar commits to the physical demands.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>1990s Hollywood: the industry, the predators, the occult underground. The world is dream logic—Hollywood as hellscape. The surrealism operates by its own rules.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production with surreal vision: 90s LA rendered as nightmare, the body horror visualized, the occult staged as practical effects. The style is unique—Lynchian without being Lynch.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The body horror: what Lisa must do for the curse, what the curse does to others. The spectacle is uncomfortable—vomit, transformations, the supernatural rendered as organic. Not for the squeamish.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Revenge, Hollywood exploitation, what women must sacrifice, whether revenge is worth the cost. The show explores these through surreal metaphor. The body horror is thematic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Lisa's revenge, the curse's consequences, the Hollywood industry's predation. The structure is surrealist nightmare—the drive is watching the spiral. The pacing is dreamlike.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The revenge is taken, the cost is paid, the ending is appropriately surreal. The story concludes but not neatly. Ambiguous and fitting.</p>
