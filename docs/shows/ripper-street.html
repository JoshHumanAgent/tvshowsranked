            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Whitechapel, 1889. Jack the Ripper's murders have stopped, but the streets are still dangerous. Detective Inspector Edmund Reid, Detective Sergeant Bennet Drake, and American surgeon Homer Jackson investigate crimes in the wake of the Ripper. Matthew Macfadyen, Jerome Flynn, Adam Rothenberg lead a Victorian police procedural: forensics emerging, the police force developing, Whitechapel as both crime scene and community.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Matthew Macfadyen's Reid is the moral center—obsessed with justice, struggling with family. Jerome Flynn's Drake is the loyal sergeant with violent tendencies. Adam Rothenberg's Jackson is the American with secrets. MyAnna Buring as Long Susan runs the brothel. The ensemble creates a community in Victorian Whitechapel.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1889 Whitechapel: the streets, the police station, the brothels, the docks, the emerging technologies (early forensics, photography, fingerprinting). The production design is meticulous—this is Victorian London rendered with budget and care. The world is specific and immersive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Period drama production values: the streets look lived-in, not set-dressed. The photography captures both the gloom and the humanity—Whitechapel as home, not just crime scene. The style distinguishes the show from other Victorian procedurals.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the streets, the costumes, the violence of Victorian crime. The budget shows in the sets and locations. This is production design as spectacle—London as character.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The birth of forensics, the development of policing, class and crime in Victorian London, the psychology of investigators. The show explores the early days of scientific detection—fingerprints, ballistics, toxicology. The themes are present; the procedural dominates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic crimes with serialized character arcs. Each episode has a case; each season has a larger threat (the Ripper's shadow, organized crime, personal enemies). The pacing is solid BBC procedural—case resolved, characters developed, momentum maintained.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons, complete. The show was cancelled after season 2, revived by Amazon for seasons 3-5, and given proper conclusion. Reid, Drake, and Jackson's arcs resolve. A survivor story.</p>
