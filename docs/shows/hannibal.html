            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Will Graham can inhabit the minds of serial killers. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is his psychiatrist. What Will doesn't know: Hannibal is a serial killer himself. Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy star in Bryan Fuller's prequel to the Thomas Harris novels—art horror as network television. The cuisine is exquisite; the violence is operatic; the relationship is the point.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Mads Mikkelsen's Lecter is different from Hopkins—more restrained, more terrifying in his elegance. Hugh Dancy's Will Graham is fragile, brilliant, breaking. The supporting cast (Caroline Dhavernas, Laurence Fishburne, Gillian Anderson) matches the leads. The performances are the show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Baltimore and Florence: the FBI, the psychiatric practice, high society. The world is Lecter's stage—elegant, cultured, deadly. The murder tableaux are art installations. The world is beautiful and horrifying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Bryan Fuller's visual style is unparalleled on television: the food photography, the murder scenes as art, the dream sequences. Every frame is composed. The style is the substance—beauty and horror intertwine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is aesthetic: the meals Hannibal prepares, the murder displays, the architecture. The violence is staged as gallery art. This is horror as sensuality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Identity, empathy, monstrosity, the relationship between hunter and hunted, whether Will and Hannibal are enemies or soulmates. The show explores its themes through the relationship—two men who understand each other better than anyone. Sophisticated and disturbing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1: Hannibal hides. Season 2: Will suspects. Season 3: Hannibal revealed, then escaped. The drive is the relationship—each season escalates the intimacy and the danger. The pacing is deliberate, sometimes slow, always beautiful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, cancelled. The third season ends on a cliff-cliffhanger that suggests continuation. The cancellation was fan-protested; Fuller had more planned. The ending is incomplete but beautiful.</p>
