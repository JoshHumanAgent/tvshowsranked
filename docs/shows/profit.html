            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Jim Profit is a sociopath climbing the corporate ladder at Gracen & Gracen. He was raised in a box, literally, and emerged determined to win at any cost. He manipulates, seduces, destroys, and smiles through it all. Adrian Pasdar's performance is mesmerizing—a villain protagonist decades before that was acceptable. Fox canceled it after four episodes; critics called it the most evil show on television. It was also ahead of its time: corporate America as jungle, profit as religion.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Adrian Pasdar as Jim Profit is unforgettable—smooth, ruthless, charming, broken. The supporting cast (Lisa Zane, Lisa Darr, Keith Szarabajka) creates worthy opponents and pawns. Profit addresses the camera, directly sharing his philosophy. The performance is unapologetic; the villainy is the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Corporate America in the 1990s: office politics, boardroom conspiracies, the mechanisms of power. The Gracen & Gracen company is a complete ecosystem—departments, rivalries, secrets. The business details are credible; the Machiavellian tactics are plausible. Office Space without the comedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>1990s network television: functional, dated. The visual style doesn't distinguish itself; the strength is performance and writing. The box flashbacks have crude effects but effective impact. Shows its age.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle—this is boardrooms, offices, apartments. The drama is entirely psychological and interpersonal. The "spectacle" is watching Profit plan and execute schemes. Television as Machiavelli.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Corporate capitalism as moral vacuum. Profit isn't evil because he's damaged—he's damaged because capitalism rewards damage. The show questions whether success and ethics can coexist. The villain protagonist forces viewers to reconsider what they want from television heroes. Ahead of its time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each episode presents a corporate problem; Profit solves it through manipulation, deception, or worse. The serialized elements track his history in the box and his ultimate ambition. Eight episodes isn't enough, but each is dense with scheme and counter-scheme. Compulsive viewing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Canceled before completion. The eight episodes tell a partial story—Profit ascends but hasn't reached his goal. The ending we got is open, appropriate to the premise but not satisfying as conclusion. A show destroyed by being too ahead of its time.</p>
