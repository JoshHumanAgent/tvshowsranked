            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A body is found in the Channel Tunnel, half in France, half in Britain. Two detectives—Elise Wassermann (French) and Karl Roebuck (British)—must work together despite cultural and temperamental differences. The Bridge's concept adapted for Anglo-French tension: a killer exploiting the border, detectives whose methods clash. Clémence Poésy and Stephen Dillane create a partnership that transcends formula. Three seasons of procedural excellence.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Clémence Poésy as Elise is unforgettable: socially awkward, brilliant, hiding vulnerability beneath coldness. Stephen Dillane as Karl is her opposite: warm, chaotic, charming, damaged. Their partnership develops slowly, credibly, across three seasons. The guest performances vary; the leads are exceptional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The border as crime scene: the Tunnel, Calais, Folkestone, the crossing points where nations and cultures meet. The show captures both French and British policing, the politics of cooperation, the media environment. The world is specific, grounded, educational about cross-border investigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>British-French TV production: competent, clear, functional. The Channel Tunnel is used effectively; the border landscapes are photographed well. The style serves the story without distinguishing itself. No complaints, no memorable moments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is detective work: interviews, evidence, procedural detail. The "spectacle" is the partnership forming, the cultural clashes resolving, two people learning to work together. Drama rather than action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The border as metaphor: where nations meet, where laws change, where identity becomes complicated. The show explores Anglo-French tensions, European cooperation, the practical challenges of cross-border justice. The themes are present but secondary to the procedural pleasures.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season is a self-contained case; the partnership develops across seasons. The first season (the original Tunnel case) is strongest; subsequent seasons vary in quality. The drive is procedural—solving the case while learning to work together. Competent, engaging, sometimes exceptional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, each with resolution. The third season addresses Elise's past and provides closure for the partnership. The ending respects the characters and the journey. A complete adaptation that knew when to stop.</p>
