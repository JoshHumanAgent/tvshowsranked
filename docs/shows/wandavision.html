<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A grieving witch manifests an entire sitcom reality to escape her pain. WandaVision is Marvel's most experimental project—a love letter to television history that gradually reveals itself as a study of trauma, denial, and the lies we tell ourselves to survive. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany deliver career-best performances in a show that asks why we retreat into fantasy when reality breaks our hearts. The sitcom gimmick isn't a gimmick; it's the whole point. Wandavision is what happens when grief gets superpowers.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8.5/10)</h3><p>Elizabeth Olsen carries the show through seven decades of sitcom styles, each requiring different comedic muscles before revealing devastating dramatic depth. Paul Bettany proves Vision can be charming, funny, and heartbreaking. Kathryn Hahn's Agatha is a delight—campy villainy with genuine edge. The cast fully commits to the bit.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>The sitcom decades are meticulously crafted—from 50s black-and-white to 2000s mockumentary. Each era has accurate laugh tracks, aspect ratios, and production design. The real world creeps in at the edges, creating jarring juxtapositions that serve the theme. Westview is both a haven and a prison.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>DP Jess Hall earned his Emmy. The visual language shifts every episode—classic 4:3 for the 50s, vibrant sitcom colors for the 70s, handheld documentary style for the modern era. The "real world" scenes use MCU's established visual vocabulary, creating clear distinction between fantasy and reality while making the fantasy more appealing.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>Marvel budget applied to sitcom aesthetics creates uncanny spectacle—Vision's helicopter colors bleeding into a black-and-white world, the Hex barrier's pixelated edge, the Scarlet Witch reveal. The effects serve story, creating wonder and unease in equal measure.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Trauma processing through media consumption. The comfort of nostalgia. Toxic positivity. The ethics of forcing your fantasy on others. Colonial undertones in Westview. WandaVision packs more ideas into nine episodes than most shows manage in seasons. The thesis: sometimes we need our fantasies to survive, but surviving isn't living.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3><p>The central mystery—"what's really happening?"—drives the first half beautifully. The reveal changes the question to "what will Wanda do?" The momentum shifts from curiosity to concern. Some find the MCU-mandated climax generic compared to the invention of early episodes. But the emotional core remains intact.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3><p>Complete as a limited series with an emotional finale, though clearly designed to launch MCU Phase 4. Wanda's arc from denial to acceptance to self-sacrifice is satisfying even if the surrounding action is formulaic. The post-credit scenes connect to larger franchise, but the story works on its own terms.</p></div></section>
