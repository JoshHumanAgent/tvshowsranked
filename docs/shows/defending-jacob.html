            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Andy Barber is an assistant district attorney. His son Jacob is accused of murdering a classmate. The evidence is circumstantial but mounting. Andy investigates, discovers family history he'd hidden, and must decide: what does he believe, and what will he do? Chris Evans (Captain America) is Andy—controlled, increasingly desperate. Michelle Dockery is the mother whose certainty wavers. Apple TV+'s first prestige thriller.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Chris Evans drops the Captain America persona: Andy is controlled, competent, but cracking. Jaeden Martell as Jacob is the question mark—is he innocent? Michelle Dockery as Laurie carries the mother's anguish. The performances are subtle, building doubt and fear.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Suburban Massachusetts: the high school, the courtroom, the homes. The world is affluent normality disrupted by accusation. The "murder gene" subplot introduces family history as genetic determinism. The world is specific enough to convince.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ production: the Massachusetts seasons, the courtroom, the interrogation. The style is thriller-appropriate—shadow, tension, the family fracturing visibly. The visual language serves the doubt.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is a family and a courtroom: conversations, arguments, evidence. The "spectacle" is the doubt—watching parents question their child, watching certainty erode.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Parental love vs. truth, the genetics of violence, whether we can truly know our children, what we'd do to protect family. The show explores these through the procedural without easy answers. The ambiguity is the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The mystery propels: did Jacob do it? Each episode adds evidence, removes certainty, reframes the question. The pacing is designed for binge—each ending demands the next episode. The courtroom structure provides momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The ending is ambiguous—appropriate to the material. The show refuses to provide certainty; the family's story concludes but the truth remains unclear. The resolution respects the ambiguity.</p>
