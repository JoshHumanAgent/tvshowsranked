            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1880s New York. Old money faces new money across Fifth Avenue. Marian Brook arrives from Pennsylvania to live with her aunts; Peggy Scott is a Black writer navigating a world built to exclude her. Julian Fellowes brings Downton Abbey's formula to American capitalism's birth: the opera house battles, the railroad fortunes, the social climbers, the gatekeepers. Carson from Downton is here too. It's comfort food in corsets.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon as the aunts—restraint and charity, old money's competing philosophies. Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell is the engine: new money refusing to wait. Louisa Jacobson as Marian and Denée Benton as Peggy provide the young perspectives. The ensemble is large; performances are consistently strong. Fellowes knows how to cast.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Gilded Age New York: the drawing rooms, the ballrooms, the opera houses, the Brooklyn Bridge under construction. The show captures the era's ambition and anxiety—old names versus new fortunes, the emerging Black middle class, the maids and footmen beneath the glamour. Comprehensive and educational.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO period drama production values: costumes, locations, lighting. The visual language is Downton refined—every frame is beautiful, every dress is perfect. The wealth is visible; the effort is visible. Period television at its most polished.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is wealth: mansions, balls, dresses, opera seasons. The production design shows Gilded Age excess with precision. This isn't action spectacle; it's material culture as performance. The period is the production value.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Old money versus new money, the construction of American identity, race and class in post-Civil War America. The themes are present but gentle—this is comfort viewing, not social critique. The exploration of Black characters' lives adds depth, but the show's heart is in the wealth battles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Episodic social maneuvering with serialized arcs: Marian's marriage prospects, Peggy's writing career, Bertha's opera house war. The pacing is Fellowes-standard: multiple storylines in each episode, crises and resolutions. Comforting rather than propulsive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues; arcs advance without obvious endpoint. The Downton model suggests long-term planning, but resolution is distant. Currently delivering quality without urgency toward conclusion.</p>
