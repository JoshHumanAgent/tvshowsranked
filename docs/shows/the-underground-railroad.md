## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.50**

Scoring 8, Thuso Mbedu's Cora provides vulnerable determination; Joel Edgerton's Ridgeway is terrifying in his conviction. The performances are grounded and devastating. The acting serves the historical weight.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

Scoring 9, the alternate-history Underground Railroad is built with imagination and specificity—each state as different nightmare. The show creates a fantastical journey through real horror. The world building is extraordinary.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 10

**Raw Score: 10 | Weighted: 1.00**

Scoring 9, Jenkins crafts some of television's most beautiful images—candles, fields, fire, faces in darkness. The cinematography is painterly and purposeful. It's visual poetry.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

Scoring 7.5, the images are beautiful even when depicting horror. Jenkins finds transcendence in suffering. The visual power comes from composition rather than action.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

Scoring 8.5, the show explores American slavery, freedom, the mythology of progress, and intergenerational trauma. The density is historical and philosophical. It's among the most intellectually ambitious limited series.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 6

**Raw Score: 6 | Weighted: 0.90**

Scoring 7, the episodic structure moves through different states/stations, which can feel uneven. Some chapters are propulsive; others are contemplative. The pacing is deliberately varied.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

Scoring 7.5, the final episode provides closure for Cora's journey while acknowledging endless struggle. It's not triumphant. The ending honors the ongoing cost of freedom.
