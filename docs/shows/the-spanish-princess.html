            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Charlotte Hope as Catherine: determined, Catholic, tragic. Ruairi O'Connor as young Henry VIII: athletic, impatient, destined for tyranny. The supporting cast captures Tudor court intrigue. The performances balance ambition and sympathy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Early Tudor England: the court, the politics, the Spanish-English alliance, the looming break with Rome. The world is the pre-reformation Tudor court—complete and atmospheric.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Starz production: Tudor England rendered with detail, the court politics staged for intimacy. The style matches The White Princess—historical drama focus on character.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the court, the ceremonies, the royal progresses. This is political marriage—not battles but negotiations and children. The production serves the history.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Duty vs. love, political marriage, what women owe to their countries vs. themselves, faith vs. pragmatism. The show explores Catherine's struggle for legitimacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Catherine must marry Henry, must produce an heir, must survive the politics. The structure is Tudor survival—the stakes are the dynasty. The drive is Catherine's determination.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons. The story covers Catherine's early years with Henry, ending before the divorce. The conclusion is known history; the drama is in the journey. Incomplete historically but complete as arc.</p>
