            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Kimmy Schmidt was rescued from a bunker where a reverend kept her and three other women for 15 years. She emerges into modern New York, determined to live. Her resilience is superhuman. Her social skills are 15 years out of date. Ellie Kemper is Kimmy: optimism weaponized. Tina Fey and Robert Carlock created the sunniest show about trauma.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Ellie Kemper as Kimmy: the sunniest survivor, bright-eyed but damaged. Tituss Burgess as Titus Andromedon: the aspiring performer, selfish and wonderful. Carol Kane as Lillian: the landlord who hates gentrification. Jane Krakowski as Jacqueline: the wealthy socialite. The ensemble is sitcom-perfect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>New York as seen by Kimmy: tiny apartments, bad jobs, Broadway dreams, the social dynamics she doesn't understand. The world is sitcom New York—heightened, specific, absurd.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Multi-camera sitcom aesthetics: bright, studio-bound, designed for laughs. The style is 30 Rock successor—heightened reality, rapid jokes. The visuals serve the comedy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is sitcom: apartments, rehearsals, misadventures. The "spectacle" is Titus's performances and Kimmy's optimism. Comedy, not production.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Trauma and resilience, whether optimism is strength or denial, starting over, the cost of abuse treated with comedy. The show tackles dark material with unusual lightness—it's about survival, not victimhood.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Kimy's adjustment to the modern world, Titus's career, Jacqueline's divorce. The structure is episodic with serialized character development. The drive is Kimmy's journey from bunker to functional adult.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons with interactive special. Kimmy grows, Titus succeeds, the characters find resolution. The show ends appropriately. A complete statement.</p>
