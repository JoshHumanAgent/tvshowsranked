            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Morning television, America's waking ritual. Then the anchor is fired for sexual misconduct. The co-anchor who survived is forced to share the desk with a field reporter who doesn't play the game. Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon as women navigating an industry that doesn't protect them. Steve Carell as the disgraced anchor who might be a monster. Apple's flagship drama about #MeToo, power, and the cameras we point at ourselves.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jennifer Aniston as Alex Levy is the performance of her career: a woman who's survived by knowing the game, suddenly forced to question it. Reese Witherspoon as Bradley Jackson is raw ambition without polish. Steve Carell as Mitch Kessler navigates sympathy and condemnation. The supporting cast—Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Gugu Mbatha-Raw—is uniformly strong. Billy Crudup's network executive is particularly memorable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p> broadcast television as ecosystem: the studios, the control rooms, the executive suites, the morning routine millions watch. The show renders both the public face and the private machinery—makeup and branding and ratings and the compromises that accumulate. The world is specific and recognizable: this is morning TV as it exists.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple production values: polished, bright, televisual in the best sense. The behind-the-scenes sequences use handheld cameras to create immediacy; the on-air segments are static and composed. The style mirrors the industry—polished surface, chaos underneath. Competent and appropriate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is production value: beautiful people in beautiful lighting, New York apartments and corporate jets. The "spectacle" is watching powerful people navigate crises, watching institutions protect themselves. Emotional drama, not visual grandeur.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>#MeToo, power asymmetry, the performance of femininity, the complicity of survivors. The show explores what happens when the story breaks—is he guilty? Should she have known? What does loyalty cost? The themes are timely and handled with nuance, though occasionally the show feels like it's working through a syllabus.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 is propulsive: the firing, the transition, the fallout, the secrets. Season 2 struggles with COVID and direction. Season 3 pivots to new conflicts. The drive varies—some episodes are pure momentum, others feel like marking time. The show hasn't found its long-term engine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show continues, exploring new conflicts after resolving initial ones. Whether it will achieve thematic closure or continue indefinitely is unclear. The first season is a complete arc; subsequent seasons feel like they're searching for new urgency. Promise unfulfilled, potentially.</p>
