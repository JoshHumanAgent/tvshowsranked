            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Sam Fox is a working actress in Los Angeles, raising three daughters alone while caring for her aging mother who lives across the street. Pamela Adlon created and stars as Sam—in many ways, it's her life. No plots, no arcs, just life: auditions, teenagers, dating, menopause, the business of being a mother and daughter and artist. FX's quietest show, and one of its best.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Pamela Adlon as Sam is one of television's most real characters: exhausted, loving, failing, trying. Mikey Madison, Hannah Riley, Olivia Edward as her daughters are each distinct. Celia Imrie as Phil, Sam's mother, is maddening and lovable. The casting is the show—everyone is real.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Los Angeles as lived, not as fantasized: the auditions, the agents, the traffic, the neighborhood. The world is domestic—Sam's house, her mother's house, the daughters' schools. The specificity is the point: this is exactly what this life feels like.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The style is observational: handheld, natural, following life as it happens. The lighting is available light; the editing is patient. This is comedy-drama filmed like documentary. The aesthetic matches the content—nothing flashy, everything true.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. Family dinners, teenage arguments, auditions, aging parents. The "spectacle" is life itself—watching real people navigate ordinary extraordinariness. The show is anti-spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Motherhood, daughterhood, aging, the artist's life, the female body, the weight of caring for everyone while caring for yourself. The show explores what's invisible: the emotional labor women perform. It doesn't make speeches; it shows the work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The drive is life: the daughters grow, Phil ages, Sam works. There are no villains, no victories, just the accumulation of moments. For some, this is the show's brilliance; for others, it's aimless. The pacing is real time—slow, then fast, then slow again.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons, complete. Adlon knew when to stop. The final season provides closure without fanfare—a moment that captures everything. The ending is exactly right for the show: life continuing, as it does.</p>
