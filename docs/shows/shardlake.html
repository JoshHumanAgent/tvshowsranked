            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                16th-century England. Matthew Shardlake is a lawyer with a curved spine, working for Thomas Cromwell, investigating monasteries scheduled for dissolution. C.J. Sansom's novels adapted: Tudor politics, murder, and a detective who's an outsider in his own time. Arthur Hughes is Shardlake—disabled, brilliant, determined. Sean Bean is Cromwell, the dangerous patron. Historical mystery as Tudor noir.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Arthur Hughes embodies Shardlake: the physical difference that makes him an outsider, the intelligence that makes him essential, the moral compass that conflicts with Cromwell's ruthlessness. Sean Bean's Cromwell is understated menace. The supporting cast creates the monastery world—monks with secrets, politics with stakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Henrician England: the fear of Cromwell, the destruction of monasteries, the religious revolution that made enemies of old allies. The monastery of Scarnsea is specific—its monks, its history, its secrets. The world is historical mystery at its best: accurate, atmospheric, plot-relevant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Period production with appropriate gloom: candlelit corridors, monastery cloisters, Tudor architecture. The style serves the mystery—shadows for secrets, confined spaces for claustrophobia. The visual language is competent without being distinctive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Tudor England rendered: the monastery, the travel, the execution sites. The spectacle is period atmosphere rather than action. The production value is visible; the budget is not blockbuster.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Power, disability, faith vs. politics. Shardlake's physical difference is treated seriously—Tudor attitudes to disability, his resilience, his awareness of being judged. The Reformation provides context: monasteries being destroyed, a king remaking religion. History with depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four-episode mystery: a murder at Scarnsea, Cromwell's demands, Shardlake's investigation. The structure is classic whodunit in period dress. The stakes are political—failure means Cromwell's displeasure, which means death. The pacing is appropriate; the mystery is satisfying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Miniseries adapting one novel. The mystery resolves; the larger story (Shardlake's career) could continue if renewed. Sansom wrote multiple novels; the adaptation potential exists. Currently complete as a single story.</p>
