            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Peter Sutherland is an FBI agent working the Night Action desk—a phone that never rings. Then it rings. A woman is calling about an attack on her family; her aunt worked at the White House. Peter is drawn into a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels. Gabriel Basso is Peter—earnest, capable, increasingly paranoid. Matthew Quirk's novel adapted into Netflix's answer to 24: breathless, paranoid, twisty.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Gabriel Basso carries the show: the protagonist who's not sure who to trust. Luciane Buchanan as Rose, the caller, provides the partnership. Hong Chau, DB Woodside, Eve Harlow—the ensemble is solid. The performances serve the thriller without distinguishing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Washington DC: the White House, the FBI, the secret programs. The Night Action desk is a clever invention—a phone line for isolated agents. The bureaucratic machinery of intelligence is rendered with enough accuracy to convince.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix thriller production: Washington rendered with gloss, the action staged with clarity. The style is competent without distinguishing—it serves the plot without calling attention to itself. The pace is the aesthetic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is action: chases through DC, fights in confined spaces, shootouts. The budget supports the thrills without excess. This is television action, not film—competent, sufficient, forgettable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Trust no one, conspiracy at the highest levels, the lone agent against the system. The themes are thriller-standard. The show doesn't explore them deeply—it uses them for momentum. Entertainment over substance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Breathless. Every episode ends with a twist or escalation. The conspiracy unfolds, the body count rises, the stakes escalate. This is binge television in the purest sense—designed for "one more episode" momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Season 1 resolves its immediate conspiracy; season 2 continues. The show is built for continuation rather than conclusion. Currently delivering thrills without clear endpoint.</p>
