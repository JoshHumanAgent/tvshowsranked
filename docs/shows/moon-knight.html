            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Steven Grant is a gift shop clerk with sleep issues. He blacks out and loses time. Then he discovers he shares his body with Marc Spector—a mercenary who serves the Egyptian god Khonshu. Oscar Isaac is both (and more): dissociative identity disorder as superhero origin. The MCU goes dark and weird.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Oscar Isaac creates distinct personalities: Steven the anxious clerk, Marc the hardened mercenary, and more. The performance is the show—Isaac shifts between identities with different voices, body language, and presence. The supporting cast (May Calamawy, Ethan Hawke) supports him.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Egyptian mythology in the MCU: Khonshu, Ammit, the scales of judgment. London and Cairo rendered with detail. The world expands the MCU into magic and gods while staying grounded in Steven's psychological experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Disney+ MCU production: London, Cairo, the Egyptian afterlife. The style embraces the weird—the shifting identities visualized, the god-scale scenes. The action is clear despite the character complexity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The Moon Knight suit, the Egyptian gods, the battles in the afterlife. The spectacle is MCU-budget superhero action with Egyptian mythological elements. The psychological elements are the real show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Identity, mental illness as superpower (and burden), whether we are our actions or our intentions, what we owe to those who share our bodies. The show explores DID with unusual respect for the source material.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Steven discovers who he is. Marc reveals who he was. The god conspiracy unfolds. The structure is mystery—what's happening, who are the alters, what does Khonshu want? The pacing is propulsive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries (with potential continuation). The identities reach equilibrium; the threat is defeated. The ending provides closure while leaving the door open. A complete story.</p>
