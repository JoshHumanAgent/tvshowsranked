## What It Feels Like to Watch

Eve Polastri is an MI6 officer who becomes obsessed with Villanelle — a psychopathic assassin working for a shadowy organization. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game that becomes something more complicated: an obsession, a relationship, and a meditation on identity.

This is unlike any spy thriller you've seen. Villanelle is a killer — she's murdered dozens of people, often in brutal ways — but she's also charismatic, funny, and oddly vulnerable. Jodie Comer (Villanelle) and Sandra Lin-Eve are extraordinary, creating a connection that's magnetic despite being built on violence.

The show is stylized: bright colors, elaborate costumes, and moments of surreal humor. It's not trying to be realistic; it's trying to be compelling.

The show ran for four seasons, and each one tried something different. The first is the best — a perfect thriller that redefined the genre. Later seasons struggled to maintain the quality, but the performances remained strong.
