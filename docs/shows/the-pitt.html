            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Being trapped is the point. One shift, one hospital, 15 hours in real-time. Trauma arrives, gets treated or doesn't, replaced by the next trauma. The fluorescent lights never turn off. The coffee runs out. You're watching emergency medicine as war—not the heroic kind from network TV, but the grinding, exhausting kind that real doctors live. Noah Wyle returns to the genre he defined, now older, harder, carrying what 30 years of television medical drama has taught everyone.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Noah Wyle anchors as Dr. Michael "Robby" Robinavitch—a senior attending with the thousand-yard stare of someone who's seen too much. The supporting ensemble is younger, hungrier, still developing. The show focuses on the job rather than personalities, which is honest but limits emotional investment. Acting is strong but the character work is still in progress.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>One hospital, rendered in forensic detail. The ER becomes a machine with moving parts: triage, imaging, surgery, psych, social work. The Pitt feels like a real place—the nurses' station, the break room, the parking garage where people go to scream. Each department has its own culture, its own rules. This is institutional television at its most specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Real-time format imposes visual constraints: long takes, handheld cameras, the chaos of emergency care. The style is documentary-adjacent—functional rather than beautiful. But there's power in the unadorned approach. When the camera lingers, it means something. The filmmaking serves the realism.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is medical—procedures rendered with gruesome authenticity. This isn't about explosions or chases; it's about chest compressions, intubation, the mechanics of keeping people alive. The "spectacle" is the system functioning under pressure, which is compelling in its own way but visually muted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The real-time conceit is the hook: 15 episodes, one hour each, covering one shift. This isn't revolutionary (24 did it), but applied to medicine, it creates unique tension. The show explores burnout, healthcare system dysfunction, the impossibility of doing everything. Themes are present but not yet fully developed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The clock is the villain. Each episode covers one hour of a 15-hour shift, and the format creates relentless momentum. Patients arrive, crises escalate, staffing problems compound. The real-time structure makes every delay meaningful, every intervention urgent. It's exhausting by design—and addictive for the same reason.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. The show is still finding itself, but the first season delivers a complete arc: the shift ends, the doctors survive (mostly), the day is done. Resolutions are provisional, as they are in real hospitals. The ending honors the premise. Whether the show can sustain beyond its gimmick remains to be seen.</p>
