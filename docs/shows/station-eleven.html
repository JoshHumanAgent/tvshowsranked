            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A flu pandemic wipes out civilization. A traveling symphony performs Shakespeare in the ruins. Before the collapse, an actor dies on stage; after, his connections—ex-wife, audience member, the child who witnessed—navigate a world where art still matters. Emily St. John Mandel's novel adapted into television that's less about apocalypse than about what survives. "Survival is insufficient."

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Mackenzie Davis as Kirsten, the actress who survives; Himesh Patel as Jeevan, the reluctant protector; Danielle Deadwyler as Miranda, the woman who wrote the comic that gives the show its title. The performances are understated, internal. The child actors (Matilda Lawler as young Kirsten) are remarkable. Everyone carries grief quietly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Post-apocalyptic Michigan: the abandoned airport, the settlements, the roads where danger lurks. The pre-pandemic world is rendered as precious memory. The Symphony's travels create geography: what's been lost, what remains. The world is sad and beautiful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>HBO production: the pandemic is sudden, the collapse is quiet, the aftermath is visually poetic. The show finds beauty in ruin—sunsets over empty highways, stages in abandoned buildings. The visual language is mournful without being grim.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is absence: empty cities, abandoned homes, the quiet of a world with fewer people. The "spectacle" is emotional—art continuing after everything ends. Subtle beauty rather than blockbuster apocalypse.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Art as survival, memory as resistance, the connections between strangers. The show explores what makes life worth living when civilization ends—theater, music, stories, the comic book that connects characters across time. Philosophical without being academic. "Survival is insufficient" as organizing principle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The show jumps in time: before the pandemic, the early days, twenty years after. The structure is puzzle-box—connections emerge slowly. The drive is understanding: how do these people connect? What happened to whom? Patient viewers rewarded.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. All threads connect; the comic's significance is revealed; the final episode brings characters together across time and distance. The ending is hopeful without being sentimental. Appropriate, beautiful, finished.</p>
