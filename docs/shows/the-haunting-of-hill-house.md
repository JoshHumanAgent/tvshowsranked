## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Crain family moves into Hill House to renovate it and sell it. What they don't know is that the house doesn't want to let them go.

*The Haunting of Hill House* is a ghost story, but not in the way you might expect. It's not about jump scares or gore. It's about memory, trauma, and the things we carry with us long after we've left them behind.

Mike Flanagan, the creator, tells this story through time. We see the family in 1992, when they lived in the house, and we see them in the present, as adults who have spent decades trying to escape what happened. The storytelling is non-linear, jumping between timelines, and the effect is disorienting in the best way. You slowly piece together what happened in that house, and the horror comes not from monsters but from understanding.

The ghosts in this show are genuinely unsettling. They're not CGI creations or CGI creations — they're people frozen in moments of terror, appearing in doorways and reflections, always watching. But the real ghost is the house itself, with its Red Room — a mysterious space that appears in different forms across different times, always drawing someone in.

The adult actors are exceptional. Victoria Pedretti is heartbreaking as Nell, the youngest daughter who cannot escape the house's pull. Carla Gugino is magnificent as the mother, Olivia, whose grip on reality slowly loosens. Henry Thomas, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, and Michiel Huisman round out a cast that makes you believe in this family — which is essential, because what happens to them is devastating.

But it's the children who really shine. The young actors playing the Crain kids — particularly Lulu Wilson as young Nell — deliver performances that are haunting in the truest sense. You see things in their eyes that no child should have to carry.

The finale, "Silence Lay Steadily," brings everything together in a way that feels both inevitable and surprising. The house is defeated, but not destroyed. The family is broken, but not beyond repair. And the show leaves you with a question that lingers: can we ever truly escape the things that happened to us?
