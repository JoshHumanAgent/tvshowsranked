            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Marcella Backland is a detective with blackouts. When she wakes up, she doesn't know what she's done. She returns to the Met to investigate a serial killer whose methods match a case she worked on a decade ago. Anna Friel is Marcella—fractured, brilliant, possibly dangerous. Hans Rosenfeldt (The Bridge) created a British noir where the detective might be the killer. Each season reinvents the premise; Marcella reinvents herself.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Anna Friel is magnetic: Marcella's instability, her rage, her desperate need to know what she's done when she blacks out. The supporting cast changes each season, but Friel is the constant. The performance is physical—Marcella's violence comes from somewhere broken.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>London crime: the Met, the families, the money laundering, the Balkan connections. The world expands across seasons—season 3 moves to Belfast with a new identity. The settings are specific; the noir atmosphere is European in sensibility.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Dark, cold, noir. The blackouts are rendered visually—Marcella's gaps in memory. The style supports the instability: nothing is certain, including what we see. British crime drama aesthetics at their darkest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>Minimal spectacle. Crime scenes, interrogations, London streets at night. The "spectacle" is Marcella's blackouts—what she might have done, what blood she might have on her hands. Psychological thriller, not action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Memory, identity, the capacity for violence we don't acknowledge. Marcella's blackouts raise questions: if she kills during a blackout, is she guilty? The show explores the violence beneath respectable surfaces—Marcella's, her family's, society's. Uncomfortable questions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a case, but the real drive is Marcella: what is she, what has she done, can she be saved? The blackouts create constant tension—will she discover she killed someone she cares about? The pacing is propulsive; the twists are genuine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons with shifting premises. Each season resolves its case; Marcella's arc transforms across seasons. The ending is ambiguous—is she saved, or has she become something new? Appropriate to the material, though open to interpretation.</p>
