            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Violence as choreography. A man fresh out of prison steals a dead sheriff's identity and starts enforcing his own brand of justice in Amish country. Every episode ends with blood on the floor. The fight scenes are among the best ever filmed for television—brutal, inventive, consequence-laden. It's pulp fiction elevated by execution, an action movie that never becomes repetitive across four seasons.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Lucas Hood (the name he steals) is played by Antony Starr with feral intensity—a criminal pretending to be law, and increasingly unsure which side he's on. Ivana Miličević as Carrie/Anastasia is his love interest/partner-in-crime, torn between her past and her cover life. Ulrich Thomsen as crime lord Kai Proctor is genuinely menacing. The supporting cast—Job the hacker, Sugar the bartender, the Amish community—are colorful but secondary. Strong ensemble, but lead-driven.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Banshee, Pennsylvania—a small town where Amish simplicity meets criminal enterprises. The show creates a believable ecosystem: the sheriff's station, Proctor's operation, the Native American casino, the Amish farms. Each location has rules, hierarchies, politics. The world is contained but complete. The Pennsylvania Dutch setting is unique in television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Cinemax doesn't stint on production value. The fight scenes are shot with clarity and impact—every punch lands, every cut has purpose. The show proves action can be intelligently filmed. The Amish country landscape provides visual contrast: pastoral beauty interrupted by violence. This is television that looks like cinema.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>If violence is spectacle, Banshee delivers. Car chases, heists, gunfights, prison riots, cage matches—the show finds new ways to stage action across its run. The fight choreography deserves special praise: inventive, brutal, character-revealing. Each action sequence advances story rather than interrupting it. This is how action television should work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The premise is pure pulp: criminal becomes sheriff, enforcing his own justice while hiding from his past. This isn't deep thematic television; it's genre executed with unusual skill. The show explores identity (who is Lucas Hood when no one knows his real name?), but the pleasures are visceral rather than intellectual. Surface pleasures, exceptionally rendered.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Relentless. Every episode combines case-of-the-week tension with serialized storyline momentum. The show knows its genre and delivers: a problem, escalating stakes, explosive resolution, cliffhanger. This is television designed to be consumed—action pulp at its most addictive. The pacing never flags across four seasons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons, planned from the start. The ending delivers: Lucas confronts his past, Carrie chooses her family over him, Propector's empire falls. Not every story wraps perfectly, but the core narrative completes satisfyingly. The show knows when to end and ends well—an increasingly rare quality.</p>
