## What It Feels Like to Watch

In Copenhagen, a young girl is found murdered. Detective Sarah Lund (Sofia Helin) begins her investigation — and what follows is one of the most complex, slowest, and rewarding crime dramas ever made.

This is the original *The Killing* — the show that inspired the American remake (which was also excellent). The Danish original is darker, more atmospheric, and more patient. Each season covers 20 days, with each episode representing one day. The focus isn't on the investigation's procedural aspects but on the impact of the crime on victims, families, and the community.

Sofia Helin is remarkable as Lund — a detective who is brilliant at her job but difficult as a person. She's cold, distant, obsessed with her work to the detriment of her personal life. The show doesn't try to make her likeable; it simply tries to make her human.

The production is stark: Copenhagen in winter, gray skies, urban decay. The atmosphere is oppressive, adding to the sense that this crime will have no easy resolution.

This isn't a whodunit — the show often reveals the killer early. It's about the journey, the investigation, and the cost of justice.
