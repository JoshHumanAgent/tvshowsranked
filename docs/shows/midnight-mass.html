<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">A young man returns to his isolated island hometown. A new priest arrives. Miracles begin. But these aren't normal miracles. Mike Flanagan created religious horror as community study: faith, addiction, and something ancient on an island.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3><p>Kate Siegel as Erin: the pregnant woman who sees clearly. Zach Gilford as Riley: the addict who escaped. Hamish Linklater as Father Paul: the priest with secrets. Samantha Sloyan as the zealot. The ensemble creates the community.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Crockett Island: isolated, dying, religious. The world is the community—the church is the center, the secrets are the foundation. The setting is perfect for what unfolds.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: the island, the church, the darkness. Flanagan's style is atmospheric—the horror is built through light and shadow. The monologues are staged with patience.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is religious horror: the miracles, the transformation, the apocalyptic finale. The supernatural is revealed gradually, then accelerates.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Faith and doubt, addiction and redemption, religious certainty vs. skepticism, what happens when miracles are real, the cost of eternal life. Flanagan's most theological work.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>The miracles begin, the community changes, the truth emerges. The structure is slow burn—the horror builds through character. The drive is revelation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The horror is revealed; the community faces apocalypse. The ending is devastating and beautiful. Flanagan's best.</p></div></section>
