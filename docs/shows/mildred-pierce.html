            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Depression-era Glendale, California. A mother raises two daughters alone after divorce, building a restaurant empire through sheer determination. One daughter loves her unconditionally; the other—Veda—resents her for being working class. Kate Winslet inhabits Mildred with complete commitment: the weariness, the pride, the blind spot for a daughter who will never love her back. It's James M. Cain's novel filmed with HBO resources and Todd Haynes' meticulous direction.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Kate Winslet's Mildred is one of television's great performances—a woman whose strength is also her blindness. Evan Rachel Wood as Veda is terrifying: privilege weaponized against the mother who provides it. The supporting cast—Guy Pearce, James Le Gros, Melissa Leo—creates a complete world. Every performance is calibrated, period-appropriate, emotionally true.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>1930s Southern California rendered in forensic detail: the interiors, the restaurants, the social hierarchies, the Depression's effect on different classes. The world is Mildred's creation—her restaurants, her home, her relationships—and watching it built is witnessing labor translated into identity. The production design is museum-quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Todd Haynes' direction is painterly. The color palette is saturated, almost Technicolor, contrasting with the story's emotional darkness. Every frame looks composed—the restaurant openings, the beach houses, the confrontation scenes. The mini-series format allows visual development uncommon in television.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Period spectacle: restaurant designs, fashion, automobiles, architecture. The spectacle of class aspiration rendered visible—Mildred's restaurants as statements, her home as testament to success. This isn't action spectacle; it's material culture as character. Subtle but effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The show explores mother-daughter dynamics with novelistic depth: the daughter who mirrors you, the daughter who rejects you. Class anxiety runs throughout—Mildred's success can never erase her working-class origin in Veda's eyes. The Depression is context for questions about survival, ambition, the costs of success. Rich material handled with intelligence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Five episodes, each feature-length. The pace is deliberate—this is a character study, not a thriller. Narrative momentum builds through relationship dynamics rather than plot mechanics. Some viewers will find it slow; those who appreciate character exploration will find it rewarding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>A complete miniseries with devastating resolution. Veda's betrayal is inevitable; Mildred's blindness continues until it can't. The ending collapses Mildred's carefully constructed world, forcing acknowledgment of what she's refused to see. The resolution is tragic but earned—a perfect adaptation of Cain's novel.</p>
