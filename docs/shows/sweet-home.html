<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Residents of a crumbling apartment building transform into monsters reflecting their inner demons—and the survivors must decide whether to fight, flee, or embrace the change. Sweet Home is Korean horror with a philosophical streak: what if your monster form was shaped by your deepest desire? The show combines creature-feature tension with genuine character study. Apartment living becomes pressure cooker; your neighbor might become a tentacled horror; the military might bomb everyone to contain the infection. It's claustrophobic, creative, and unexpectedly emotional.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3><p>Song Kang's Cha Hyun-su is suicidal, isolated, and the last person you'd expect to become a hero—but that's the point. The ensemble residents each get monster-origin backstories: the firefighter, the musician, the mother and child. The performances capture panic, sacrifice, and the moment despair becomes something inhuman. Korean drama intensity applied to horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3><p>The Green Home apartment complex is a character: cramped, stained, full of hidden spaces and forced proximity. The monster transformation rules emerge organically—desire shapes form. The outside world (military containment, government failure) presses against the windows. The show builds mythology through survival, not exposition.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7.5/10)</h3><p>Practical effects for many monsters give weight that CGI would lose. The apartment building's vertical horror is captured in tracking shots up stairwells and across floors. Lighting creates dread without obscuring action. Korean horror tradition (The Wailing, Train to Busan) applied to series format.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3><p>The monsters are the draw. Each has distinct design reflecting its human's psychology—a protein-obsessed bodybuilder into mass of muscle, a mother into protective sphere. The spectacle serves character. Action sequences (chases, fights, escapes) are coherent and tense.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Desire and monsterhood. The question "what would you become?" haunts every transformation. Depression, isolation, family obligation, romantic longing—each inner demon takes physical form. The show suggests becoming a monster might not be horror but release for some. It's Korean philosophical horror: monsters as the self made visible.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Monster threat escalates. Military threat approaches. Character secrets reveal. The survival-horror structure provides constant stakes—resources depleting, alliances shifting, transformations imminent. You watch to see who becomes what and who survives how.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3><p>Season 1 ends with ambiguity. Some escape, some transform, some die. The military solution creates new horrors. Season 2 expands the world beyond the apartment. The emotional arcs resolve enough, but the larger story continues. You're signing up for Korean horror marathon, not standalone.</p></div></section>
