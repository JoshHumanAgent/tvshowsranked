            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Emma Hedges works as a lab assistant at the Scottish Institute of Forensic Science. When an online course recreates her mother's murder, she investigates. Three women at the institute—Emma, a professor, and a detective—become involved in separate cases. Scottish crime drama with forensic science focus.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Molly Windsor as Emma: the young woman investigating her mother's death. Laura Fraser as the professor, Jennifer Spence as the detective. The three women create the center. The performances are BBC solid.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Dundee, Scotland: the forensics institute, the police, the cases. The world is specific to forensic science—the lab is the setting. Scottish crime with technical detail.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Channel 4 production: Dundee photographed grey and Scottish, the lab rendered with detail. The style is functional—crime drama aesthetics without distinction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is forensic science: labs, evidence, investigation. The "spectacle" is the science—watching evidence analyzed. British crime procedural.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Forensic science, cold cases, women in science, personal vs. professional. The show explores these through the cases. The forensic focus distinguishes it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Emma's mother's murder, the professor's case, the detective's investigation. Three threads that eventually connect. The structure is mystery driven by multiple cases.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons. The first season resolves Emma's mother's case; the second continues with new cases. The show wasn't designed for long running. Complete enough.</p>
