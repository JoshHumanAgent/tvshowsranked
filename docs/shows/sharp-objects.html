<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Camille Preaker returns to her hometown to report on a child's murder. She's an alcoholic with fresh self-harm scars. Her mother is cold. Her half-sister is strange. Gillian Flynn's novel adapted by Marti Noxon: Missouri gothic, family horror, small-town secrets.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>Amy Adams as Camille: the wounds are visible and invisible. Patricia Clarkson as Adora: the mother who controls with cruelty. Eliza Scanlen as Amma: the sister with secrets. The performances are Southern gothic perfection.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Wind Gap, Missouri: the old money, the poverty, the heat, the secrets everyone knows. The world is Southern small-town gothic—beautiful and rotting.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>HBO production: the heat, the houses, the Southern decay. Jean-Marc Vallée directed—the style is intimate, the camera close, the secrets visible.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is Southern gothic: the houses, the porches, the heat. The "spectacle" is the damage—Camille's scars, the family secrets. Atmosphere over action.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Mother-daughter damage, self-harm as control, small-town complicity, what families protect. The show explores generational trauma with unflinching honesty.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Who killed the girls? What happened to Camille? What is Adora hiding? The investigations are murder and family. The pacing is slow burn—secrets revealed gradually.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries. The killer is revealed; the family horror is exposed. The ending is devastating. Amy Adams' best performance.</p></div></section>
