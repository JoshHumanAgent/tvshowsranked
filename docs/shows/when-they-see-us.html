            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p>When They See Us is rage made art. Ava DuVernay's miniseries tells the story of the Central Park Five—five Black and Latino teenagers coerced into confessing to a crime they didn't commit, then imprisoned for years while the system that failed them congratulated itself on a job well done. It is one of the most essential works of American television ever made.</p>
            <p>The four episodes are structured chronologically: the night of April 19, 1989, when the five boys were arrested; the trial that convicted them; their years in prison; and the 2002 exoneration that came too late to give them back their youth. DuVernay doesn't show the rape at the center of the case—not once. She focuses entirely on the boys: Antron, Yusef, Kevin, Raymond, and Korey. Their faces. Their terror. Their confusion. Their gradual realization that the system doesn't care about truth.</p>
            <p>The cast is uniformly remarkable, but Jharrel Jerome's performance as Korey Wise is the series' center. Korey was 16 when he was arrested—not even a suspect, just someone who had come to the police station to support a friend. He ended up spending 13 years in prison, including years in adult facilities where he was beaten and spent months in solitary confinement. Jerome plays him with a gentle sweetness that makes the horror worse. He shouldn't be there. None of them should.</p>
            <p>The series doesn't let the audience off the hook. It shows exactly how the confession was extracted: through hours of interrogation, threats, lies, promises that if they just admit what "happened," they can go home. The detectives aren't portrayed as monsters—they're ordinary men doing what the system designed them to do, which is to close cases by any means necessary. Linda Fairstein, the prosecutor who built her career on this case, appears in archival footage, her face a mask of certainty that never wavers even as the evidence collapses.</p>
            <p>This is not entertainment. It's documentation. It's testimony. It's a demand that we see what happened, that we understand how easily justice can be perverted when the accused are presumed guilty because of who they are.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Characters & Acting (10):</strong> Every performance is perfect. The young actors playing the boys at different ages, the parents watching helplessly, the prosecutors convinced of their own righteousness. Jharrel Jerome's Emmy win was entirely deserved.</p>
            <p><strong>Conceptual Density (9):</strong> Race, class, power, the presumption of guilt, the difference between law and justice. The show explores these through story, not lecture, allowing viewers to feel the weight of systemic failure.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution (10):</strong> The exoneration provides closure, but it's muted. The years are gone. The trauma remains. The series ends with the real men, now middle-aged, speaking about what was taken from them. It's devastating and perfect.</p>
