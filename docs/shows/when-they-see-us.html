<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">1989. Five Black and Latino teenagers are arrested for the assault of a jogger in Central Park. They didn't do it. Ava DuVernay's miniseries follows their lives through the trial, the convictions, the prison years, the exoneration. The Central Park Five as human beings destroyed by a racist system.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>The young actors (Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Marquis Rodriguez) play the boys. The adult actors (Jharrel Jerome, Chris Chalk, Justin Cunningham) play the men. Niecy Nash as the mother who never stops. The performances are devastating.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>1989 New York: the panic, the media, the legal system, the prisons, the families. The world is the machinery that destroys five lives. Every detail is historical and infuriating.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: the interrogation scenes, the prison cells, the courtroom. The style serves the horror—watching lives destroyed by process.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. This is injustice: interviews, trials, years passing. The "spectacle" is the system working as designed. Crushing reality.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (10/10)</h3><p>Racism in the justice system, coerced confessions, the machinery of wrongful conviction, media as weapon, the cost of injustice, families destroyed. Essential viewing.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>The arrest, the trial, the prison years, the exoneration. Each episode is phase—the structure is the timeline of destruction. The drive is horror at what happened.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3><p>Four episodes, complete. The exoneration provides some justice, but the damage is done. The ending is legal victory, not moral resolution. Essential.</p></div></section>
