            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                The Mikaelsons are the original vampires—they created all others. They're also a family with a thousand years of resentment. Klaus, Elijah, and Rebekah return to New Orleans, the city Klaus helped build, to reclaim it from his protégé Marcel. The Vampire Diaries spinoff became something more: vampire family drama with Shakespearean stakes and French Quarter atmosphere.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Joseph Morgan as Klaus is the centre: the hybrid who craves love and destroys everything he touches. Daniel Gillies as Elijah provides the moral compass. Claire Holt and later Riley Voelkel as Rebekah. The family dynamic drives everything—the performances are soap-opera committed to supernatural stakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>New Orleans supernatural politics: the vampires, werewolves, witches, and humans who share the Quarter. The world is complete—vampire hierarchy, witch magic, werewolf curses. The mythology expands across seasons without collapsing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>CW production values: French Quarter atmosphere, supernatural effects, Gothic romance. The style serves the teen-adult crossover audience. New Orleans is photographed with appropriate darkness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Supernatural spectacle: vampire speed, werewolf transformations, witch magic. The effects are TV-budget but sufficient. The spectacle serves the family drama rather than overwhelming it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Family, loyalty, the weight of eternity, whether monsters can love. The Mikaelsons are dysfunctional for centuries; the show asks whether redemption is possible for the irredeemable. The themes are present; the soap opera dominates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Power struggles, family betrayals, ancient curses, eternal love. The drive is constant supernatural soap opera—every episode has a threat, a revelation, a reversal. Binge television structure perfected.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Five seasons with conclusion. The Mikaelson siblings' story ends (or transforms). The finale provides closure while setting up Legacies. Complete for this chapter of the franchise.</p>
