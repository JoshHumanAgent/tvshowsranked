## What It Feels Like to Watch

Noah Solloway is a married man. Alison Lockhart is a married woman. They meet in Montauk, and they begin an affair. *The Affair* explores what happens next — and it's much more complicated than you'd expect.

This is not a soapy drama about infidelity. It's a thoughtful examination of how relationships fracture, how identity shifts, and how the stories we tell ourselves about our lives might not be true. The show uses a unique narrative device: each episode is told from a different character's perspective, and the same scenes play out differently depending on who's narrating.

The first season is extraordinary. Ruth Wilson is brilliant as Alison — a woman dealing with grief and searching for meaning. Dominic West is Noah — a writer whose self-perception doesn't match reality. Their chemistry is undeniable.

The show evolves over five seasons, following the characters through divorce, remarriage, parenthood, and the long tail of their decision. It's not always easy to watch, but it's always compelling.
