            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Jack Ryan is a CIA analyst who keeps ending up in the field. John Krasinski is the fourth actor to play him, and the most believable as an intelligence officer who'd rather be analyzing data than shooting people. Each season is a self-contained thriller: Venezuela, Russia, international conspiracy. The action is Tom Clancy's technothriller sensibility adapted for prestige TV—competent patriotism, geopolitical stakes, and one Everyman who keeps saving the world.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>John Krasinski brings Everyman warmth to Jack Ryan—he's good at his job, not a superhero. Wendell Pierce as Jim Greer provides CIA gravitas. Abbie Cornish, Michael Kelly, Noomi Rapace—each season adds quality. The performances are professional; Krasinski is the star his character needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The CIA, the field operations, the geopolitics: Venezuela's collapse, Russian interference, Myanmar's civil war. The show does its research—the intelligence world feels credible. Each season builds a complete crisis with moving parts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Amazon Prime production values: global locations, coordinated action sequences, clear geography. The action is shot for comprehension—you know where everyone is, what's at stake. The style is Tom Clancy's realism elevated by modern TV budgets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Set pieces: raids, chases, covert operations, firefights. The action is frequent and well-staged. Each season has signature sequences—the Venezuela extraction, the Russian infiltration. This is spectacle television with intelligence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Terrorism, geopolitics, the limits of intelligence, the cost of security. The show operates in Clancy's worldview—bad actors exist, good people must stop them, institutions try their best. The themes are present but not explored deeply.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season is a self-contained thriller: a threat emerges, Jack investigates, stakes rise, resolution. The pacing is propulsive—eight episodes per season, every minute counts. Binge television designed for momentum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Four seasons, complete. Each season resolves; the series doesn't build toward a finale so much as offer standalone adventures. Jack Ryan's final season provides appropriate closure. The John Krasinski era is done.</p>
