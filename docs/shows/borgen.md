## What It Feels Like to Watch

Birgitte Nyborg Christensen is a minor centrist politician in Denmark. Then, through a series of improbable events, she becomes the first female Prime Minister of Denmark — and *Borgen* becomes the show that proves political drama doesn't need American settings to be compelling.

This is a show about power, idealism, and what happens when you try to change the world from within the system. Birgitte's journey from unexpected leader to seasoned politician is endlessly fascinating, made richer by the ensemble around her: her spin doctor Kasper, journalist Katrine, and husband Phillip, all navigating their own relationships to power.

The first three seasons (2010-2013) are tightly focused and exceptional. The writing is sharp, the politics accessible despite the Danish setting, and the character work deep. Each season takes on different challenges — coalition government, media manipulation, international diplomacy — while maintaining personal stakes.

The fourth season, released nearly a decade later on Netflix, expands the scope but loses some of the intimate focus. Still, it's a welcome return to a world that feels both foreign and oddly comforting.

*Borgen* proves that political drama doesn't need Westminster or Washington. The Danish Parliament (Christiansborg, hence the title) becomes a stage for universal questions about representation, compromise, and the cost of power.
