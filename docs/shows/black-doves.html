            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Helen Webb is a spy pretending to be a politician's wife. Her lover is killed. Her cover is blown. Her handler calls in Sam, a killer from Helen's past, to protect her. Keira Knightley is Helen; Ben Whishaw is Sam. Joe Barton created a Christmas-set spy thriller: assassinations, secrets, and unlikely partners in London's underworld.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Keira Knightley as Helen: the spy who became a wife and mother, now exposed. Ben Whishaw as Sam: the killer who can't stop. The chemistry between them drives the show. The supporting cast maintains the tension.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>London at Christmas: the spy world hidden beneath the festivities, the Black Doves organization, the political machinations. The world is specific—Whitehall, embassies, safe houses, and Christmas markets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Netflix production: London photographed at Christmas, the contrast between holiday warmth and spy cold. The style is atmospheric—the lights of Christmas, the darkness of espionage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the spy thriller: assassinations, chases through Christmas markets, confrontations. The action is staged with precision. The spectacle serves the character.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Identity, the lives we build vs. the lives we hide, whether love and deception can coexist, loyalty to self vs. organization. The show explores these through Helen's double life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Six episodes of momentum: Helen's exposure, Sam's arrival, the conspiracy revealed. The structure is propulsive—each episode ends with escalation. Designed for binge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Season 1 complete; season 2 announced. The first season provides resolution while leaving room for continuation. The story is ongoing.</p>
