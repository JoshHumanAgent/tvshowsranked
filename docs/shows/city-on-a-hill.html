            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Early 1990s Boston. The city is corrupt, the police are compromised, and the justice system needs reform. Jackie Rohr is an FBI agent who's been in Boston too long—he's corrupt, effective, untouchable. Decourcy Ward is the new ADA from Brooklyn with a mission. Kevin Bacon and Aldis Hodge play the odd couple forced to work together. Chuck MacLean created Boston crime as moral wasteland.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Kevin Bacon as Jackie Rohr is magnificent: the corruption, the ability, the rationalization. Aldis Hodge as Decourcy provides the moral center without being naive. Jill Hennessy, Lauren E. Banks, and Matthew Del Negro create the compromised world around them. Bacon carries the show; Hodge grounds it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>1990s Boston: Irish mob, Italian mob, corrupt FBI, desperate prosecutors, the racism that shapes everything. The city is specific—neighborhoods, accents, the "city on a hill" that's actually in the gutter. The world is built with journalistic attention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Period Boston: the cars, the clothes, the neighborhoods not yet gentrified. The style is crime-drama competent—functional, atmospheric, not distinguishing. Showtime production values applied to Boston setting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is crime: shootouts, raids, crime scenes. This is not action television; it's corruption television. The "spectacle" is watching Jackie Rohr operate—charming, damaging, surviving.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Corruption as system, whether effective corrupt justice is better than ineffective pure justice, race and policing in Boston, the Catholic Church's role. The show explores moral compromise without easy answers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a case: armored car robberies, federal corruption, gang violence. Jackie and Decourcy's relationship provides the consistent tension. The pacing is solid crime-drama—investigation, betrayal, resolution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, cancelled. The third season provided some closure but the show was building toward something larger. Jackie's arc remains unresolved. Good while it lasted; incomplete.</p>
