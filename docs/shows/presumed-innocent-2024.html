            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Rusty Sabich is a prosecutor accused of murdering his colleague and mistress. The evidence is circumstantial but damning. The case tears apart his family and his career. Jake Gyllenhaal stars in the adaptation of Scott Turow's novel: legal thriller as family destruction.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Jake Gyllenhaal as Rusty: the accused, the flawed, the desperate. Ruth Negga as his wife, Peter Sarsgaard as the rival. The performances capture the destruction of certainty. Gyllenhaal is excellent as the ambiguous defendant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The prosecutorial office, the courtroom, the family home. The world is legal thriller standard—familiar but effective. The stakes are personal and professional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ production: Chicago rendered with atmosphere, the courtroom staged for tension. The style is thriller-noir—shadow and ambiguity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. This is legal thriller: courtrooms, interviews, evidence. The "spectacle" is the doubt—is Rusty guilty? The tension is intellectual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Presumption of innocence, circumstantial evidence, marital destruction, whether we can know the truth, the legal system's failures. The show explores justice and doubt.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The trial: evidence presented, witnesses examined, doubt seeded. The structure is courtroom thriller—each episode reveals more, each twist changes perspective. The pacing is propulsive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The verdict is rendered; the truth is suggested but not confirmed. The ending preserves the ambiguity that defines legal thrillers. Satisfying.</p>
