            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1980s Kazan, USSR. Teenage street gangs fight for territory, respect, and survival. Marat is drawn into this world. The Soviet Union's collapse is coming; the boys live in its shadow. Russian crime drama based on real events: youth violence, generational trauma, the end of an empire.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The ensemble cast creates the gang dynamics: loyalty, betrayal, coming of age in violence. The performances are raw—young actors representing Soviet youth with no future. The intensity is Russian drama at its most visceral.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1980s Kazan: the Soviet Union before collapse, the courtyard gangs, the codes of honor, the generational poverty. The world is specific and historical—a society rotting before it falls.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Russian production: 1980s USSR rendered with detail, the violence staged with realism, the courtyards photographed with period accuracy. The style is gritty—authentic to time and place.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is violence: gang fights, street battles, the brutality of Soviet youth. The production doesn't glamorize—the violence is ugly and real. Not for everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Boys without fathers, a society collapsing, violence as expression, the codes that replace law, what happens when empires fall. The show explores Soviet collapse through youth gangs. Profound historical context.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Marat's initiation, the gang wars, the Soviet collapse approaching. The structure is rise and fall—youth drawn into violence, the consequences, the historical shadow. The pacing is relentless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The story of the gangs, the collapse, the aftermath. Based on real events, the ending is history. Satisfying as narrative and document.</p>
