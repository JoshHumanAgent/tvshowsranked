## What It Feels Like to Watch

Stranger Things arrived as a perfect nostalgia piece—a love letter to 1980s Spielberg films, Stephen King novels, and the era of Steven Spielberg. But it became something more: a genuinely compelling supernatural drama.

Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, the series begins when young Will Byers disappears and his friends, family, and local police discover a parallel dimension called the Upside Down. What follows is a story about friendship, family, and the monsters that lurk in the shadows.

The show works because of its characters. The kids—Millie Bobby Brown's Eleven, Finn Wolfhard's Mike, Gaten Matarazzo's Dustin—are instantly lovable. The adult characters—Winona Ryder as Joyce, David Harbour as Hopper—ground the supernatural in real emotion.

But Stranger Things is more than nostalgia. It's a show about trauma, about how the past continues to haunt us. The Upside Down is a place where negative emotions become physical monsters.
