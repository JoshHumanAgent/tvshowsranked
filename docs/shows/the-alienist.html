            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                1896 New York. A serial killer targets boy prostitutes. Dr. Laszlo Kreizler—a criminal psychologist, an "alienist"—investigates. With him: a newspaper illustrator and a police secretary. Caleb Carr's novel adapted: the birth of criminal profiling, Gilded Age New York, darkness beneath the wealth.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Daniel Brühl as Kreizler: the alienist, damaged and brilliant. Luke Evans as Moore: the illustrator drawn into darkness. Dakota Fanning as Sara Howard: the secretary who wants to be detective. The performances capture period psychology.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>1896 New York: the mansions, the tenements, the corruption, the poverty. The world is Gilded Age in all its contradiction—wealth and squalor. The period detail is immersive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>TNT production: New York rendered in gaslight and shadow, the period photographed with atmosphere. The style is Victorian noir—the past as foreign country.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is period: the mansions, the slums, the crime scenes. The production value serves the investigation—not action but atmosphere. Victorian true crime.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Criminal psychology's birth, what makes killers, childhood trauma, wealth's indifference to poverty's suffering. The show explores these through the first profiling case.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The killer must be found: clues, profiles, investigations, danger. The structure is serial killer thriller—each episode reveals more about the perpetrator. The drive is constant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons, adapting two Carr novels. Each season resolves its case; the characters continue. The show is complete within its seasons. Period crime done right.</p>
