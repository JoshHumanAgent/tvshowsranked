            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                A murder in a small Northeast China town connects three timelines: 1990, 1998, and 2016. The same actors play different ages across decades. The case haunts everyone involved. Chinese drama as literary mystery: time, memory, and a northern industrial town in decline.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The ensemble plays across decades: aging, regret, the weight of the unsolved case. The performances are Chinese drama at its finest—subtle, cumulative, devastating. The aging makeup and performance capture different lives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Northeast China across three decades: the industrial boom, the decline, the present emptiness. The town is character—changing with time, holding the murder in its memory. Specific and atmospheric.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Chinese prestige drama production: the northern town rendered in three eras, the snow, the factories, the decline. The style is literary—the camera observes time passing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is atmospheric: the snow, the factories, the three timelines visually distinguished. This is memory mystery—not spectacle but texture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Time, memory, how the past shapes the present, industrial decline, what we lose when towns die, whether cases can be solved after decades. The show explores these through literary structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Three timelines converge on the murder: what happened, how it shaped everyone, whether it can be solved. The structure is puzzle—past and present revealing each other. The pacing is deliberate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Complete miniseries. The case is solved; the timelines converge; the weight lifts. The ending provides resolution and emotional payoff. Chinese prestige drama with proper conclusion.</p>
