<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">John Dutton owns the largest ranch in Montana. Developers want it. His children fight over it. Kevin Costner is Dutton: the patriarch who will do anything to protect his land. Taylor Sheridan created the modern Western: succession in the American West.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Kevin Costner as John Dutton: the patriarch, the protector, the immovable object. Luke Grimes, Kelly Reilly, Wes Bentley as the children. The performances embrace the Western genre.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Montana ranching: the reservation, the developers, the land, the politics. The world is the American West as battleground—ranching vs. development vs. tribal sovereignty.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Paramount production: Montana photographed with grandeur, the ranch as kingdom, the West as character. The style is epic—the land is the point.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the land: the mountains, the cattle, the ranch. This is Western cinema on television budget. The landscape is the star.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3><p>Land ownership, what we inherit, the West as myth and reality, development vs. preservation, what fathers owe children. The show explores through family drama.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3><p>Protect the ranch. Each season brings new threats: developers, politicians, family. The structure is Western siege—the land must be defended.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3><p>Five partial seasons. Costner left; the ending is in production. The show continues with the Dutton saga. The resolution is pending.</p></div></section>
