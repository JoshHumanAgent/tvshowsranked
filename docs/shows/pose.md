## What It Feels Like to Watch

In 1980s New York, the ballrooms are alive with competition. Houses — chosen families led by "mothers" — compete in elaborate categories: voguing, realness, executive realness. Behind the glamour, AIDS is spreading, discrimination is rampant, and these marginalized figures are building their own world.

*Pose* is a revolution in how we see television. Created by Ryan Murphy with Steven Canals, it features the largest cast of transgender actors in series regular roles ever — and that representation never feels tokenistic. The performances are extraordinary: Michaela Jaé Rodriguez (then Mj Rodriguez) as Blanca, the mother who starts her own house after receiving an AIDS diagnosis; Dominique Jackson as Elektra, a legendary figure who refuses to be tamed; Billy Porter as Pray Tell, the emcee with a heart of gold.

The show is visually stunning — costumes and sets that capture the excess and beauty of the ballroom scene. The music, featuring original tracks and period-appropriate hits, keeps energy high. But what elevates *Pose* beyond style is its substance: it's a show about chosen family, about survival, about the cost of living authentically in a world that doesn't want you.

The first season establishes the world and its characters. The second digs deeper into the AIDS crisis with heartbreaking clarity. The third, truncated by the pandemic but no less powerful, brings arcs to emotionally satisfying conclusions.

This is television that matters. It tells stories that have been ignored, centers voices that have been marginalized, and does so with grace, power, and incredible style.
