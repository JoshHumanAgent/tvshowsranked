## What It Feels Like to Watch

Pose is a groundbreaking celebration of a marginalized community that transformed television. Set in the New York ballroom scene of the 1980s and 1990s, it tells the stories of trans women, gay men, and others who built their own families when mainstream society rejected them.

You watch Pose and feel joy and pain in equal measure. The ballroom competitions are exhilarating—costumes, performances, and fierce competition. But beneath the glamour lies the reality of the AIDS crisis, poverty, and violence against the community.

The series features the largest transgender cast in television history. The performances are heartfelt and powerful. Mj Rodriguez's Blanca is the emotional heart—a woman who builds a house family and fights for her community.

Pose is also historical. It documents a cultural movement that influenced fashion, music, and art. It's a love letter to a community that refused to be erased.
