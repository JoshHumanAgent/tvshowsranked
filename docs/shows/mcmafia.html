            <h2>What It Feels Like to Watch</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">McMafia is a globetrotting crime thriller about a British-raised Russian whose family's criminal past catches up with him, dragging him into a world he'd tried to escape. Alex Godman has built a legitimate life in London finance, but when his uncle's enemies threaten his family, he finds himself applying banking skills to criminal enterprise, moving money and arranging deals across borders that law enforcement can't effectively patrol.</p>

            <p>The show's title comes from Misha Glenny's nonfiction book about global organized crime, and the series takes that research seriously. This isn't gangsters with guns but criminals with spreadsheets, and the threat comes from the system's complexity rather than individual violence. The operations span from Moscow to Mumbai, Tel Aviv to Cairo, and the production shoots on location, giving each city the specificity that green-screened backgrounds wouldn't provide.</p>

            <p>James Norton plays Alex as a man who believes he can control what he's entering, and his gradual realization that criminality isn't something you manage is the show's throughline. The supporting cast creates a world of operators—some violent, some bureaucratic, all dangerous in different ways. Where McMafia struggles is in making its protagonist's fall feel inevitable rather than plotted; some of his decisions serve the script's needs rather than character logic. But as a portrait of how global crime actually operates—through finance, logistics, and corruption rather than shootouts—McMafia is smarter than most entries in the genre.</p>

            <h2>Why It Ranks Here</h2>
            <p>McMafia earns its ranking through authenticity, global scope, and a protagonist whose descent into criminality feels like a genuine tragedy. The score reflects a thriller that respects its audience's intelligence while maintaining tension.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>James Norton carries the show with a performance that captures Alex's intelligence and his growing desperation. The supporting cast creates distinct figures across multiple countries—gangsters, bankers, fixers, and family members who each have their own stakes. The international ensemble maintains quality across languages and locations.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>McMafia excels at portraying global crime as an industry rather than an adventure. The logistics of money laundering, the negotiations between different criminal organizations, the corruption that makes everything possible—it's all rendered with authority. Each city feels specific, each operation feels researched.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The visual approach is cold and controlled, matching the financial world where Alex begins and the criminal world where he ends. Location shooting gives each city authentic texture—Moscow's wealth, London's order, the chaos of criminal frontiers. The camera observes without judging.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle here is in scope rather than effects—multiple countries, complex operations, the infrastructure of international crime. There's violence, but it's quick and ugly rather than choreographed. The visual interest is in watching systems operate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Depth (7.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The show engages seriously with how global crime operates—not through dramatic heists but through financial infrastructure, political corruption, and the exploitation of difference between legal systems. Alex's fall is about the accessibility of criminal tools to anyone with the right skills and wrong circumstances.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The eight-episode structure keeps things tight—each episode advances Alex's involvement while introducing new operators and operations. The threat to his family creates stakes, and his growing network creates scope. Some plot turns feel manufactured, but the momentum carries.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6.5/10)</h3>
                <p>The ending is deliberately ambiguous—Alex has become what he feared, but the show resists easy judgment about whether his choices were necessary or inevitable. Some viewers will find the lack of closure frustrating; others will appreciate the refusal to moralize.</p>
