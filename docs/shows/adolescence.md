## What It Feels Like to Watch

Adolescence is unlike anything you've seen before. It's a British drama that unfolds in real-time, following the arrest of a 13-year-old boy for the murder of a classmate. Each episode is filmed as a single continuous take, creating an unbearable tension that never lets up.

The story isn't about whodunit—we know from the opening scene. It's about why. How did this happen? What failed? The series traces backward and forward, examining the family, the school, the online spaces where young minds are shaped.

Stephen Graham (creator of The Virtues) doesn't let anyone off the hook. Not the parents, who didn't see the signs. Not the school, which missed the warnings. Not the police, who handled it clumsily. Not the online influencers who spread poison. Not the society that creates these conditions.

The performances are devastating. The young lead carries the weight of the story with remarkable presence. Owen Cooper as the father delivers a scene that will haunt you—a man watching his son being taken away, understanding too late what he should have seen.

The production is innovative. The single-take approach forces you to witness everything—no cuts, no escapes. You experience the helplessness that the adults feel.

Adolescence is essential viewing for anyone who cares about young people, online safety, or the failure of systems meant to protect children. It's difficult to watch, but that's the point.
