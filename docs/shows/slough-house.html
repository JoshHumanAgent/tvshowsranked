            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                MI5's rejects are sent to Slough House, where Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman, repulsive and brilliant) oversees agents who've failed. They're called slow horses; they do drudge work; they're not supposed to matter. But threats keep finding them. Mick Herron's novels adapted into the anti-Bond: British intelligence as bureaucracy, spies as workplace colleagues, alcohol and regret as daily routine. The best spy show since The Americans.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Gary Oldman's Jackson Lamb is a masterpiece: disgusting, brilliant, protective without warmth, offensive without apology. Jack Lowden as River Cartwright is the capable rookie. Kristin Scott Thomas as Diana Taverner is the power broker. The ensemble (Saskia Reeves, Jonathan Pryce, Sophie Okonedo) creates a complete ecosystem of damaged professionals. Acting at the highest level.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>British intelligence as workplace: Regent's Park headquarters, Slough House's decrepit office, the politics, the bureaucracy, the maneuvering. Herron's world is le Carré updated for the era of terrorism and leaks. The intelligence community rendered with authenticity and cynicism. Complete and credible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Apple TV+ production values: London looks good, the spy craft is convincing, the action is staged with clarity. The visual style serves the story without imposing. The tone is set through performance and writing more than through image.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is occasional action: chases, confrontations, operations gone wrong. But the heart is character and dialogue. The "spectacle" is watching Lamb humiliate someone, or watching the slow horses succeed despite expectations. Low-key, effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Failure, redemption, bureaucracy as enemy, loyalty among outcasts. The show explores what happens to spies who screw up—they don't retire, they rot. The slow horses are more capable than their reputation suggests; the competent people at Regent's Park are often worse. Cynical and sophisticated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season adapts a novel; each has a complete mission while advancing character arcs. The pacing is propulsive: threats emerge, the slow horses investigate, Lamb drinks and insults and saves the day. The structure is reliable without being repetitive. Among TV's most watchable shows.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Ongoing. Each season resolves its case; the character arcs continue. Herron's novels provide material for more seasons. The trajectory is strong; the ending is distant. Currently delivering excellence without conclusion.</p>
