<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Danny Rand returns to New York after 15 years presumed dead, trained in K'un-Lun as the Iron Fist—immortal weapon and protector of a gateway to another dimension. His family's company has been stolen, his childhood friends don't recognize him, and he wants to use his powers. Marvel's Iron Fist arrived at peak Netflix-Marvel and disappointed everyone: the choreography was choppy, the philosophy superficial, and the corporate intrigue boring. Finn Jones plays Danny as privileged hippie who learned kung fu—charming but shallow. Jessica Henwick's Colleen Wing is the show's heart; her arc from dojo owner to Hand member is the most interesting thread. The Hand, the Meachums, K'un-Lun—all exist without connecting. Danny should be the world's best martial artist. The show didn't cast a martial artist.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (6/10)</h3><p>Finn Jones is miscast—Danny plays as naive rich kid, not disciplined warrior. Jessica Henwick's Colleen Wing is the MVP: her arc, fighting, and struggle carry scenes. The Meachum family provides corporate villainy. The Hand is recycled from Daredevil without innovation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (5.5/10)</h3><p>K'un-Lun is mentioned more than shown. The corporate world is bland. The Hand's plans remain vague. The show borrows from better shows without building its own foundation.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (5/10)</h3><p>Fight choreography was criticized on release—Finn Jones isn't a martial artist; editing hides what should be shown. The hallway fight tradition from Daredevil limps here. Colleen Wing's scenes have better choreography.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (4/10)</h3><p>The Iron Fist glowing hand effect works. The fighting should be spectacle and falls short. K'un-Lun glimpses in season 2 don't compensate for season 1's corporate offices.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3><p>Danny's struggle between duty and desire; corporate legacy versus spiritual training; immortal weapon protecting a dimensional gate. The themes exist but don't matter. Danny often seems to not care about either.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (5.5/10)</h3><p>Danny's return, corporate takeover, Hand infiltration—threads compete without integrating. Season 2 improves fights and changes tone but loses audience. The Defenders crossover improves Danny's character; Iron Fist alone struggles.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>Two seasons before cancellation. Season 1 resolves Danny's identity crisis and Hand plot. Season 2 shifts tone and improves but ends on cliffhanger post-cancellation. Watch if completing Netflix Marvel; otherwise skip.</p></div></section>
