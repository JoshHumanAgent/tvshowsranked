<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Flynne Fisher lives in rural America, earning money in VR simulations. Then she tests a new peripheral—a body she controls remotely in what she thinks is a game, but is actually 2099 London. The Peripheral is William Gibson adaptation: future conspiracies reaching backward through time, corporate warfare fought with stolen timelines, and one woman whose only advantage is she's underestimated. Chloë Grace Moretz makes Gibson's dense concepts feel lived-in. The show was cancelled after one season, but the season that exists is time-travel noir done right.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3><p>Chloë Grace Moretz carries the show as Flynne—smart, distrustful, adapting to impossible information. Gary Carr'sWilf provides the future's perspective. The split between Flynne's rural present and Wilf's decadent future creates contrast without confusion. The villains are corporate without being boring.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (8/10)</h3><p>Gibson's stub concept: alternate timelines that can be accessed and influenced. The future has developed the tech; the past becomes a battleground. The rural 2032 is economically depressed American South; the 2099 London is oligarchic excess. The rules are explained without drowning in exposition.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>Two distinct visual palettes: warm, saturated rural present versus cold, blue future urbanism. The peripheral sequences are seamless—you see Flynne's consciousness in a future body. The action is coherent; Gibson's concepts are visualized.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is conceptual: seeing through distant eyes, timelines branching and merging. The 2099 London has production design budget—hovercraft, drones, AR overlays. But the show prioritizes noir atmosphere over constant effects.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3><p>Stub theory, timeline manipulation, corporate warfare across decades. The show explores what happens when the future treats the past as a game—not just ethically, but technically. Multiple timelines, multiple selves, causality loops. Gibson's ideas translated to screen without simplification.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7.5/10)</h3><p>The conspiracy pulls Flynne deeper each episode. The stakes scale: from personal survival to timeline stability. The future characters need something from Flynne's past; she needs to survive both. The mystery unfolds at Gibson pace: deliberate, then explosive.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3><p>The show was cancelled after season 1. The finale sets up season 2 that will never come. The immediate plot resolves but larger arcs remain open. As an incomplete work, it's Gibson at his most accessible, but frustration is unavoidable.</p></div></section>
