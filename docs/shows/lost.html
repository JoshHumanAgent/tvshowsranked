            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on a mysterious island. Survivors from different backgrounds must work together—and they discover the island has secrets. A smoke monster, a hatch, a group called the Others, and flashbacks that reveal who these people were before the crash. JJ Abrams and Damon Lindelof created a phenomenon: mystery television that drove the internet crazy with speculation. The show that defined watercooler television.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Matthew Fox as Jack, the reluctant leader. Evangeline Lilly as Kate, the fugitive. Terry O'Quinn as Locke, the believer. Josh Holloway as Sawyer, the con man. The ensemble (Naveen Andrews, Jorge Garcia, Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim, Michael Emerson) created television's most obsessed-over characters. The performances made you care about the mystery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The island: the hatch, the Others, the Dharma Initiative, the smoke monster, the Temple, the lighthouse. The mythology expanded across six seasons, sometimes brilliantly, sometimes confusingly. The world was television's first interactive mystery—fans mapped every detail.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Network TV production in Hawaii: the jungle, the beach, the caves. The crash sequence is legendary. The style serves the mystery—everything is photographed to suggest secrets. The flashbacks and flash-forwards create visual structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the island: the crash, the smoke monster, the time travel, the nuclear explosion. The effects were network TV budget but deployed creatively. The spectacle served the mystery—the island as wonder and terror.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Faith vs. science, destiny vs. free will, redemption, whether we can escape our pasts. The show explored these through character and mythology. The philosophical depth was sometimes obscured by plot confusion, but it was present.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3>
                <p>The mystery drove everything: what is the island, what's in the hatch, who are the Others, what do the numbers mean? The flashbacks revealed character; the mysteries drove speculation. The most discussed television of its era.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Six seasons with controversial ending. Lindelof and Cuse answered some questions, ignored others, and provided a polarizing conclusion. The finale is still debated—some found it beautiful, others felt betrayed. The ending defines the show.</p>
