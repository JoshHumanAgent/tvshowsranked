<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Detective Jane Timoney transfers to New York homicide and immediately faces the hostility of an all-male squad who thinks she used politics to get promoted over better candidates. Maria Bello plays Timoney as competent, combative, and trying to solve murders while navigating sexism. The US adaptation of Helen Mirren's British classic struggles to justify its existence: why remake British prestige as American network procedural? But Bello makes Timoney her own—not Mirren's detective, but something closer to an American working cop. The cases-of-week are standard NBC police procedural; the workplace drama is above average. The show aired one season before cancellation—not because of quality, but because NBC didn't know what to do with it. Worth watching for Bello's performance; don't expect Mirren.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (7.5/10)</h3><p>Maria Bello elevates procedural material. Timoney is prickly, competent, politically savvy, and unwilling to play nice. The supporting squad (Kirk Acevedo, Brian O'Byrne, Tim Griffin) are good as hostile colleagues who slowly respect her. Aidan Quinn's lieutenant is ally but not advocate.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (6/10)</h3><p>New York homicide: precinct politics, case pressures, budget cuts. The workplace feels real—locker room, bullpen, interrogation rooms. The sexism is institutional without being cartoonish.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3><p>Standard police procedural aesthetic. The New York locations have grit without being cinematic. Bello's face in close-up carries scenes.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (2/10)</h3><p>No spectacle. Procedural television. The "visuals" are performance and dialogue.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (5.5/10)</h3><p>Sexism in policing, competence versus politics, what it costs to be the first. The show wants to explore these themes but network procedural structure limits depth. Timoney is a breakthrough character in a formula format.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (6/10)</h3><p>Case-of-week structure with workplace tension serialization. Timoney's acceptance by colleagues is the ongoing arc. Cases resolve; the respect accumulates. Standard procedural momentum.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5.5/10)</h3><p>One season, 13 episodes. Cancelled without proper ending. Timoney earns some respect; the final case is solved but no closure. The show is worth the watch for Bello, but you won't get resolution.</p></div></section>
