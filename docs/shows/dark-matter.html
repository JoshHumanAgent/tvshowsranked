            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Six people wake on a spaceship with no memories. They have their skills but not their identities. They're criminals. Or maybe they're not. The crew of the Raza discovers who they were and decides who they'll be. Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie created space opera with amnesia: Firefly meets the mystery box.
            </p>

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>The ensemble creates distinct personalities: One through Six, then their names emerge. Marc Bendavid, Melissa O'Neil, Anthony Lemke, Alex Mallari Jr., Jodelle Ferland, Roger Cross. The amnesia device allows character discovery. The android (Zoie Palmer) provides comic relief and heart.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The galaxy: corporations, rebels, space stations, rival ships. The world expands across seasons—the corporations' control, the rebellion, the alien threat. The universe is built with economy and depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Syfy production: spaceship interiors, planet surfaces, CG space battles. The budget is visible but the style is functional. The Raza becomes home through familiarity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Space battles, boarding actions, planetary landings. The spectacle is TV-budget sci-fi—enough to sell the universe, constrained by Syfy financing. The ideas carry what the budget can't.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Identity, whether we are our memories or our choices, redemption for past crimes, found family vs. biological. The show explores who the characters would be without their histories—and who they become when those histories return.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Who were they? Who's hunting them? What is the Raza's mission? The mystery box drives the first season; subsequent seasons add corporate conspiracies and alien threats. The pacing is serialized and momentum-building.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (5/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, cancelled on a cliffhanger. The mystery resolved but the story didn't. Fans campaigned for continuation; it never came. Incomplete.</p>
