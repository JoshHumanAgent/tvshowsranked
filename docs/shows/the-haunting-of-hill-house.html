<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">The Crain family lived in Hill House. It broke them. Now they're adults, still broken. One of them is dead. Mike Flanagan adapted Shirley Jackson: the house as wound, the family as haunting, grief made supernatural.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3><p>The Crain siblings: Michiel Huisman, Elizabeth Reaser, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Kate Siegel, Victoria Pedretti. Carla Gugino as the mother. The performances capture trauma as haunting. Each sibling is a wound.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (9/10)</h3><p>Hill House: the rooms, the hallways, the basement, the red door. The house is character—every room is wound. The world is the house and the family, past and present.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3><p>Netflix production: the house photographed for horror and beauty, the ghosts hidden in frames. The long takes are legendary. Flanagan's style is patient horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3><p>The spectacle is the house: the ghosts, the red room, the hauntings. The production design is meticulous—every frame has secrets.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3><p>Grief as haunting, trauma as architecture, whether the house creates the wounds or the wounds create the house, what we pass to our children. The show explores family through horror.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (9/10)</h3><p>Past and present: what happened in the house, what's happening now. Each episode is a sibling's wound. The structure is trauma revealed—slowly, painfully.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3><p>Complete miniseries (anthology format). The Crain family story resolves. The house remains. One of the best horror series ever made.</p></div></section>
