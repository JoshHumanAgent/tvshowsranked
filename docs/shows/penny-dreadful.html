            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Victorian London. Sir Malcolm Murray searches for his daughter. Vanessa Ives is possessed. Dr. Frankenstein has created a monster. Dorian Gray watches. John Logan's gothic mashup: the literary monsters of the 19th century in one narrative. Eva Green is Vanessa: horror's greatest performance.

                <h3>Characters & Acting (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Eva Green as Vanessa Ives: possessed, tormented, magnificent. Josh Hartnett as Ethan Chandler: the American with secrets. Timothy Dalton as Sir Malcolm. Rory Kinnear as the Creature. The performances are theatrical horror at its finest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (10/10)</h3>
                <p>Victorian London: the fog, the sewers, the mansions, the secrets. The world gathers every gothic monster—Frankenstein, Dorian Gray, Dracula—in one coherent universe. The period is rendered with atmosphere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Showtime production at its finest: Victorian London photographed like a horror film, the possessed rendered with practical effects, the style theatrical. The aesthetic is gothic dream.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is horror: possessions, creations, transformations. The effects are practical and theatrical. Penny Dreadful stages horror as opera.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Possession, creation, whether monsters are born or made, God and the devil, what we owe to our bodies vs. our souls. The show explores gothic themes with literary depth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>The search for Mina, then the search for Vanessa's salvation. Each season has its monster narrative. The structure is gothic serial—escalating horror, deepening character.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons, complete. Vanessa's arc resolves; the gothic narrative ends. The finale is operatic horror. Penny Dreadful: City of Angels continued in a different era. The original is complete.</p>
