            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Yoorana, Victoria. A police officer rises from his grave in the cemetery. Then more follow—people who died years ago, returning young, confused, craving something. James Hayes is the cop who knew one of them. The returned don't remember dying; they want answers. Australian supernatural drama: The Returned transplanted to small-town Australia, with specific secrets and indigenous history.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Patrick Brammall as James is the anchor: the cop with secrets, the man whose past is returning literally. Emma Booth, Sean Keenan, Hannah Monson as the returned each bring specific histories. The performances are grounded; the supernatural is treated as personal, not genre.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Small-town Australia: the cemetery, the pub, the homes, the indigenous sites. The world is specific to place—the returned carry Australian histories, indigenous dispossession, colonial violence. The world building uses supernatural premise to explore actual past.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Australian gothic: the heat, the landscape, the small-town isolation. The photography captures rural Victoria as both beautiful and uncanny. The dead are not made monstrous; they're made present. The style serves the mood.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (3/10)</h3>
                <p>No spectacle. The dead rise; they look human. The "spectacle" is emotional—watching people confront their pasts, literally. The budget goes to atmosphere, not effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Memory, guilt, whether the past can be buried, indigenous history and colonial violence. The show uses the supernatural to make characters confront what they've done, what's been done to them. The themes are Australian-specific and universal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Why are they back? What do they want? The mystery unfolds across seasons—each returned has a story, each story connects to Yoorana's history. The pacing is deliberate; the revelations accumulate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons with resolution. The mystery of why they returned is answered; the characters find varying degrees of peace. The ending is appropriate to the premise—acceptance rather than triumph.</p>
