            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Fortitude is an Arctic town where everyone has a reason to be there—escaping something, researching something, hiding from something. A murder happens, but the killer might not be human. Stanley Tucci is the detective flown in from London. Michael Gambon is the dying photographer. The town has secrets, the ice is melting, and something is in the permafrost. Nordic noir meets horror, in a town where the sun doesn't set.

            <h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Stanley Tucci brings weight to the detective role—intelligent, damaged, out of his element. Richard Coyle, Sofie Gråbøl, Michael Gambon, and the ensemble create a town of secrets. The performances are Nordic noir quality: naturalistic, intense, specific.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>World Building (9/10)</h3>
                <p>Arctic Svalbard: the endless daylight, the research station, the hotel, the mine, the community of escapees and scientists. The town is specific—isolated, wealthy, dependent on tourism that the murder will destroy. The cold is a presence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Cinematography (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Sky Atlantic production with ambition: the Arctic is photographed like a character—white, blinding, endless. The midnight sun is disorienting by design. The visual style is thriller-horror: beautiful and unsettling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is the Arctic itself: the landscape, the polar bears, the isolation. The horror elements (when they emerge) are staged with restraint. The budget supports the location; the horror is psychological before it's physical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (7/10)</h3>
                <p>Isolation, the past in the ice, human vs. nature, the ethics of scientific research. The show explores what happens when something ancient thaws—biological horror as climate allegory. The themes are present; the thriller dominates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Drive (8/10)</h3>
                <p>Each season has a mystery: what's killing people, what's in the ice, what's destroying the town. The pacing is deliberate—Nordic noir speed—but the mystery is compelling enough to pull through. The horror escalates; the stakes increase.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Narrative Path & Resolution (6/10)</h3>
                <p>Three seasons. The first is the strongest; subsequent seasons expand the mythology without matching the initial discovery. The ending resolves the immediate threat but the show lost momentum after season 1. Ambitious but uneven.</p>
