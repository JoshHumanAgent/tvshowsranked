<section class="deep-content"><h2>What It Feels Like</h2><p class="vibe-text">Superman is 40. He has two teenage sons. One might have powers. He moved the family to Smallville. Tyler Hoechlin is Clark Kent: the dad struggling with parenthood while saving the world. The CW superhero show that prioritized family over action.</p>
<h2>The 7-Dimension Analysis</h2>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Characters & Acting (8/10)</h3><p>Tyler Hoechlin as Superman: warmth and strength. Elizabeth Tulloch as Lois Lane. The sons create family stakes. The best Superman since Reeve.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>World Building (7/10)</h3>>p>Smallville restored: the farm, the community, the Daily Planet. The world is Superman as family man.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Cinematography (7/10)</h3><p>CW production: cinematic for TV, Smallville locations, the visual language of grounded superhero.</p></div>
<div class="dimension"><h3>Visual Spectacle (6/10)</h3><p>Superman action, but limited. The spectacle is secondary to family drama.</p></div>

<div class="dimension"><h3>Narrative Drive (7/10)</h3>>p>Superman saves the day; Clark raises the kids. Balanced narrative. The drive is the double life.</p></div>
