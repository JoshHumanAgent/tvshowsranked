            <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
            <p class="vibe-text">
                Colter Shaw travels America finding missing persons. He's a "rewardist"—he works for rewards, not altruism. Justin Hartley is Colter: loner, survivalist, damaged. CBS procedural based on Jeffrey Deaver's novel: The A-Team meets The Fugitive, weekly.

                <p>America's highways and small towns: each episode a new location, a new missing person. The world is procedural canvas—different setting each week. The format provides variety.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Visual Spectacle (5/10)</h3>
                <p>The spectacle is action: chases, rescues, confrontations. The missing person cases provide the stakes; the resolution provides the action. Network action spectacle.</p>

            <div class="dimension">
                <h3>Conceptual Density (5/10)</h3>
