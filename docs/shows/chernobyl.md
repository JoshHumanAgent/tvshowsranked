## What It Feels Like to Watch

Chernobyl is a horror story—but it's not the kind with monsters or jump scares. It's the horror of bureaucratic negligence, of lies told to protect power, of ordinary people sacrificed by systems that prioritize reputation over lives.

You watch the explosion of Reactor No. 4, and your stomach turns. Not because it's graphic—it's actually remarkably restrained—but because you know this happened. This is history. These were real people with real families who died painful deaths because of arrogance and lies.

The series is structured like a tragedy in five acts. Each episode builds toward the inevitable, making you complicit in the disaster even as you watch the heroes try to contain it. Valery Legasov, the nuclear physicist who became the conscience of the crisis, is our guide through hell. Jared Harris plays him with quiet devastation—the weight of truth crushing him slowly.

Stellan Skarsgård as Boris Shcherbina, the Soviet bureaucrat who becomes an unlikely hero, is a revelation. Their relationship—initially hostile, eventually respectful—provides the human core of the series. You watch two men from different worlds find common ground in catastrophe.

What makes Chernobyl essential viewing is its relevance. It's about the danger of authoritarian lies, of suppressing inconvenient truths, of trusting experts over politicians. It premiered in 2019, but it feels like it was made for this moment. The phrase "the cost of lies" has taken on new meaning.

The production is haunting. The silence of the exclusion zone. The concrete sarcophagus. The radiation burns that aren't shown but suggested. Director Johan Renck understands that what you imagine is always worse than what you see.

Chernobyl isn't easy to watch. It's not supposed to be. But it's essential—because remembering tragedy is the only way to honor its victims.
