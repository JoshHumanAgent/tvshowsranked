## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.60**

Scoring 8, Kyle MacLachlan playing multiple Coopers is extraordinary—Dougie's innocence, Mr. C's evil, the original's return. The ensemble (Lynch regulars, new faces) commits to the dream. The acting serves the surrealism.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

Scoring 9, Twin Peaks expanded across dimensions, the Black Lodge, Las Vegas, South Dakota. Lynch creates uncanny reality. The world is the show's greatest achievement—unlike anything else.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 0.90**

Scoring 9.5, Lynch directs hours of the most visually adventurous television ever made. The cinematography is experimental and beautiful. Episode 8 is pure cinema.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 0.90**

Scoring 8, spectacle arrives through surrealism—the atomic sequence, the woodsmen, the roadhouse. The show delivers unforgettable images. Lynch uses the medium as art.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

Scoring 9, the show explores time, identity, evil, dreams, and the nature of reality. The density is extraordinary and elusive. It resists interpretation—which is the point.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 5

**Raw Score: 5 | Weighted: 0.75**

Scoring 6.5, the narrative moves at Lynch's pace—which means glacial mystery punctuated by inexplicable horror. The structure defies conventional momentum. It's experiential rather than propulsive.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

Scoring 7, the finale—Cooper and Laura's return to the past, the unresolved scream—is pure Lynch. It doesn't resolve but it resonates. The ending is appropriate to the dream logic.
