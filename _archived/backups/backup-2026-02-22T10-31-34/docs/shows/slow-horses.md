## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.60**

Scoring 8, Gary Oldman's Lamb is magnificently disreputable—flatulent, brilliant, surprisingly humane. The ensemble (Jack Lowden, Kristin Scott Thomas) commits to the espionage drudgery. The performances find humor in failure.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

Scoring 8.5, Slough House and MI5 are built through bureaucratic detail—the failed spies, the institutional contempt, the London intelligence world. The show creates convincing espionage drudgery.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 0.70**

Scoring 7.5, the show captures London gray and the mundanity of spycraft. The cinematography is functional with occasional flair. The locations are appropriate.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 6

**Raw Score: 6 | Weighted: 0.60**

Scoring 6.5, action is restrained—this is people in offices and cars. The show finds tension in surveillance. Minimal spectacle.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

Scoring 7.5, the show explores loyalty, failure, institutional rot, and competence in incompetent systems. The density comes from character and observation. It's dry and smart.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

Scoring 8, each season adapts a Herron novel with propulsive plotting. The mysteries build effectively. The pacing is confident.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

Scoring 7, each season provides complete resolution while teasing future. The show maintains closure within continuity. It's satisfying.
