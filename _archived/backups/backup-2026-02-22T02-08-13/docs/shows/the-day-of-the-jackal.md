## What It Feels Like to Watch

The Day of the Jackal updates the classic assassin thriller for the modern age, delivering sleek, efficient entertainment that prioritizes plot mechanics over character depth. It's the kind of show you binge without looking up, caught in the cat-and-mouse game between the chameleon-like killer and the intelligence agent hunting him.

You watch for the procedural precision—the way each assassination is planned and executed with almost clinical detachment. The European locations provide glossy backdrops, and the pace never lets up, moving from setup to execution to escape with mechanical efficiency.

It's not revolutionary television, but it's satisfying genre fare that knows exactly what it's doing and executes with professional competence.
