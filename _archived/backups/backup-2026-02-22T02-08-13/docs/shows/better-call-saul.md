## What It Feels Like to Watch

When Better Call Saul was announced, many wondered: do we really need Saul Goodman's backstory? Six seasons later, the question answers itself. This isn't just a prequel—it's a meditation on identity, morality, and the stories we tell ourselves.

You meet Jimmy McGill, a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque who can't catch a break. He's not a criminal yet—he's just someone who cuts corners, who sees the angles, who wants to be loved. Over six seasons, you watch him become Saul Goodman, and it's heartbreaking. You understand every step. You see the wounds that drive him. You recognize the choices he could have made but didn't.

Bob Odenkirk is extraordinary. He makes you care about someone who, in Breaking Bad, was comic relief. His Jimmy is wounded, ambitious, self-sabotaging, and strangely sympathetic. The relationship between Jimmy and Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) is one of television's great romances—not because of passion, but because of mutual understanding and mutual destruction.

Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut provides the anchor. You've seen him in Breaking Bad, but here you see how he became who he was. His quiet grief, his code, his compromises—all given weight and history.

The visual language is stunning. The color palette shifts as Jimmy transforms. The cold blues of the early seasons warm into the neon of the Saul Goodman era. Every frame is composed with purpose.

Better Call Saul takes its time. It asks you to be patient. But if you give it that patience, it rewards you with a conclusion that rivals anything in television. It's proof that sometimes the journey to a destination is more interesting than the destination itself.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.70**

With a score of 8.5, the show is anchored by extraordinary performances. Bob Odenkrik's Jimmy-to-Saul transformation is masterful—he transforms from lovable loser into tragic figure entirely through performance. Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler is revelatory—her journey from ambitious lawyer to complicit partner to self-aware destruction is television's greatest underappreciated performance. Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut provides the show's moral center, his code revealed through quiet moments of grief and decision. The supporting cast—Patrick Fabian's Howard Hamlin, Michael Mando's Nacho Varga—is uniformly excellent.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

With a score of 7, the Albuquerque legal and criminal underworld is rendered with consistent authenticity. While less expansive than Breaking Bad's world, this is the same desert setting explored from different angles. The show creates a distinctive environment through its law offices—the corporate sterility of HHM versus Jimmy's strip-mall practice. The Mexican cartel operations provide geographic expansion. The world building serves character development more than spectacle; we understand Jimmy through his environments. It all connects seamlessly with the parent show while establishing its own rhythm and visual language.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 0.90**

With a score of 9, the cinematography rivals Breaking Bad in visual sophistication, sometimes surpassing it. Marshall Adams continues the visual tradition with stunning compositions throughout. The black-and-white "Gene" sequences create genuine aesthetic distinction. Color temperature tracks Jimmy's moral journey—warm tones in earlier seasons cooling as he transforms. The use of reflection, shadow, and negative space creates visual poetry. The montage sequences set to music are masterclasses in visual storytelling. The show understands that silence and stillness can be as powerful as movement.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 6

**Raw Score: 6 | Weighted: 0.60**

With a score of 6, spectacle is deliberately restrained. This is a show about lawyers and criminals, not action sequences. The rare moments of violence hit harder because of their rarity. The show's visual power comes from careful observation of faces and spaces, not from scale. The Nebraska sequences in black-and-white are visually striking but not spectacular. The "spectacle" exists in the transformation montages, the elaborate cons, and the careful framing of Albuquerque's landscapes. It's a show that trusts restraint over bombast.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

With a score of 8, the show explores identity formation, moral compromise, and the American legal system's failures. The Jimmy/Saul duality represents how people become who they fear becoming. Themes of class resentment, professional validation, and the seductive nature of shortcuts run throughout. The show interrogates the law's relationship to justice. The color-coded timeline adds structural complexity. The exploration of elder abuse, the legal profession's ethics, and the impossibility of redemption create multiple layers of meaning. It's a prequel that asks deeper questions than its progenitor.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

With a score of 9, the narrative develops with the same patient precision that characterized Breaking Bad. The show takes its time—we know where Jimmy ends up, but watching him get there is fascinating. Each season builds carefully toward its climax, with Jimmy's cons and scams providing regular satisfaction. The pacing is deliberately slower than Breaking Bad, trusting viewers to sit with discomfort. The tension between what we know will happen and how it unfolds maintains interest across six seasons. The parallel timelines create additional narrative interest.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 10

**Raw Score: 10 | Weighted: 1.50**

With a perfect score of 10, the series finale "Saul Gone" achieves something extraordinary: it rivals Breaking Bad's ending in emotional impact. The episode acknowledges the full scope of Jimmy's crimes while offering him a form of redemption through confession. The courtroom scene where Jimmy finally tells the truth is devastating—an ending that honors six seasons of moral compromise. Kim's final look, the cigarette they share, the acknowledgment that some things can't be fixed but choices can be owned—it's mature, devastating, and hopeful in its sadness. Television rarely offers endings this earned.
