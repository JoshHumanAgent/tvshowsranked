## What It Feels Like to Watch

In post-WWI Birmingham, a gang known as the Peaky Blinders — so called for the razor blades sewn into their caps — controls the streets. Their leader is Thomas Shelby, a war veteran with ambition that outstrips his circumstances.

Cillian Murphy is extraordinary as Tommy — all quiet intensity and calculating intelligence. He plays him like a coiled spring, always wound tight, always thinking three moves ahead. The performance is physical: you see the war in his posture, the weight of command in his eyes, the price of violence in his silences.

The show creates a world of industrial grime and aristocratic glamour. The Peaky Blinders start as local criminals but Tommy's ambition pushes them toward legitimacy — betting shops, racetracks, eventually politics. Every season expands the scope, bringing in new enemies: rival gangs, the police, the IRA, the Russian aristocracy, fascists.

The supporting cast is magnificent. Helen McCrory (in one of her final roles) plays Aunt Polly — the family matriarch who keeps the Blinders human even as they commit inhuman acts. Paul Anderson is Arthur, Tommy's brother, a war-damaged enforcer who becomes increasingly unstable. Tom Hardy shows up in later seasons as Alfie Solomons, a Jewish gangster whose philosophical monologues provide dark comic relief.

The show is visually stunning. Slow-motion shots of men in flat caps walking through industrial fog. Gritty streetscapes contrasted with the grandeur of Tommy's eventual estate. The anachronistic rock soundtrack — Nick Cave, Arctic Monkeys, Royal Blood — shouldn't work but absolutely does.

The final season brings everything full circle. Tommy faces his past, his enemies, and himself. The ending is ambiguous in the best way — a man who wanted everything, and got it, and found it wasn't enough.
