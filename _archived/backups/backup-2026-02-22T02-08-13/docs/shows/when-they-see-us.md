## What It Feels Like to Watch

In 1989, a woman was brutally attacked in Central Park. Within hours, police had rounded up five Black and Latino teenagers from Harlem, coerced false confessions from them, and charged them with crimes they didn't commit. When They See Us tells their story.

Ava DuVernay directs this limited series with a fury that never lets up. The four episodes follow the five men—Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise—from the night of the attack through their arrests, their trials, their prison sentences, and finally their exoneration years later when the real attacker confessed. The series jumps back and forth in time, showing how the trauma reverberated across decades.

The performances are extraordinary. Jharrel Jerome, as the youngest of the five, carries the final episode as Korey Wise, whose story is the most devastating. The actors playing the boys capture the confusion, fear, and gradual understanding that something has gone terribly wrong. The adults—John Leguizamo as Korey's father, Vera Farmiga and Felicity Huffman as the prosecutors—are cast without sympathy, which is exactly the point.

This is difficult viewing. The police coercion, the media circus, the injustice of it all—it builds into an unbearable weight. But the series is not exploitative. It's a reckoning. It shows how the criminal justice system failed these boys, how the city painted them as guilty before the trial began, how their lives were stolen from them. And it shows the quiet dignity with which they eventually rebuilt themselves.

The final episode, which shows the real men alongside the actors, is heartbreaking. You see the years on their faces. You see what was taken from them. And you understand that the story isn't really over—because the same systems that failed them then are still failing people today.

This is television as testimony. It doesn't ask you to feel good. It asks you to bear witness.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.50**

With a score of 7.5, the performances anchor this devastating true story. Jharrel Jerome's Emmy-winning turn as Korey Wise is the standout—a gut-wrenching portrayal of a child brutalized by the system. The ensemble of young actors playing the five boys captures their confusion, fear, and gradual loss of innocence. The adult cast, including Vera Farmiga and Felicity Huffman as the prosecutors, plays the institutional antagonists with chilling effectiveness.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 6.5

**Raw Score: 6.5 | Weighted: 0.97**

Scoring 6.5, the world building focuses on recreating 1980s New York—the racial dynamics, the media frenzy, the machinery of prosecution. It's period-accurate and immersive, though the scope is necessarily narrower than some dramas; this is a story about a specific injustice, not an attempt to build an entire universe. The world feels authentic but contained.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

Earning an 8, Ava DuVernay's direction brings visual poetry to horror. The cinematography moves between intimate close-ups that capture the boys' deteriorating hope and wider shots that emphasize their isolation within an indifferent system. The color palette shifts with time periods and emotional states, creating visual continuity across the fragmented timeline.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 5

**Raw Score: 5 | Weighted: 0.50**

With a score of 5, this is television as witness, not entertainment. There are no action sequences, no visual fireworks—just the stark reality of interrogation rooms, courtrooms, and prison cells. The spectacle comes from the faces of the real men shown alongside the actors in the finale, a choice more powerful than any special effect.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

Scoring 9, the show is a devastating meditation on systemic racism, the failures of criminal justice, media complicity, and the cost of trauma. Every scene interrogates how institutions destroy individual lives. The conceptual weight is heavy—this isn't just a story, it's evidence. The final episode showing the real men grounds the abstract themes in inescapable reality.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

With a score of 8, the narrative moves relentlessly from the night of the attack through arrest, trial, imprisonment, and eventually exoneration across four tightly paced episodes. The timeline fragmentation—jumping between past and present—heightens the tension while the constant return to these men's suffering creates unbearable momentum. You watch even when you want to look away.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

Earning a 9, the resolution finds its power in the truth: these men were eventually exonerated, but nothing could return their lost years. The final episode's inclusion of the real Exonerated Five alongside the actors delivers emotional catharsis while refusing easy comfort. There's no happy ending, only acknowledgment. The show honors their survival without minimizing their loss.
