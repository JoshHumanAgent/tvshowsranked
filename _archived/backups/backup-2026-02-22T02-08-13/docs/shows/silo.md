## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.50**

Scoring 7.5, Rebecca Ferguson's Juliette anchors the mystery with determined intelligence; Tim Robbins provides moral authority; the ensemble is capable. The acting serves the plot's revelations. It's professional if not transcendent.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.27**

Scoring 9, the silo itself is a character—144 floors underground, self-contained civilization, secrets buried in history. The show builds convincing vertical society with its own customs, taboos, and power structures. The world building is the show's greatest strength.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

Scoring 8, the show looks expensive—production design creates convincing underground world. The silo's scale is conveyed through careful framing. The visual approach is functional but handsome, serving the mystery.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

Scoring 7, spectacle is restrained—this is people talking in rooms, not action sequences. The world beyond the silo provides occasional visual variety. The show's power comes from implication, not scale.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

Scoring 7.5, the show explores truth, control, history, and what societies need to believe to function. The density is in the mystery—layered revelations about the silo's origins. It's intellectual science fiction.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.27**

Scoring 7, the narrative moves through mystery structure—questions, partial answers, more questions. The pacing is measured, occasionally slow. The plot propulsion comes from information rather than action.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

Scoring 6, the story is ongoing; the book series continues well beyond season one. The ending provides some closure while opening new mysteries. It's not complete but satisfying for the season's scope.
