## Category Definitions

**Characters & Acting:** Whether people on screen feel like real individuals making authentic, internally consistent choices. Depth of characterization, psychological believability, meaningful change over time, ensemble strength. Acting judged on embodiment—performances should disappear into the role.

**World Building:** How fully realized and self-sustaining the show's world feels. Consistency of rules, institutions, cultures. Sense that life exists beyond the immediate story. Benchmark: Game of Thrones/Westeros = 10.

**Cinematography:** Visual craft and intentionality. Framing, camera movement, lighting, color, composition. Emphasis on coherence and meaning. Key marker: recognizability from a single frame.

**Visual Spectacle:** Impact, ambition, and sustained presence of what is shown. Large-scale environments, production design, visual effects. Also novelty—revealing places or ways of life rarely seen.

**Conceptual Density:** How many distinct ideas the series meaningfully engages with. Political, philosophical, social, moral concepts dramatized through story. Breadth of ideas combined with coherent execution.

**Narrative Drive:** How effectively the story pulls the viewer forward. Pacing, clarity of stakes, escalation. Whether each episode meaningfully advances the narrative. Does the story move with purpose?

**Narrative Path & Resolution:** How effectively a series fulfills its narrative promises. Loop management, closure rates, earned payoffs. Rewards narrative discipline. Unresolved, rushed, or undermining resolutions lower the score.
