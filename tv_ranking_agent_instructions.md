## THE 7 CATEGORIES

### 1. Characters & Acting (20% weight)

**What it measures:**
- Do characters feel like real individuals making authentic, internally consistent choices?
- Depth of characterization and psychological believability
- Meaningful change over time
- Ensemble breadth (how many characters achieve depth, not just leads)
- Acting quality: performances should disappear into the role

**Scoring anchors:**
- **10 = Game of Thrones S1-4**: 10+ deeply realized characters (Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime, Tywin, Arya, Ned, The Hound, Littlefinger, Varys, Joffrey). The benchmark.
- **9 = Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Better Call Saul, Deadwood, Succession**: Elite ensembles with 4-6 extraordinary characters
- **8 = Mad Men, Lost, The Leftovers**: Strong ensembles, 2-3 exceptional characters, rest very good
- **7 = The Expanse, Battlestar Galactica**: Mixed bags—some great, some bland
- **6 = Foundation**: Weak characters despite other strengths

**Key question:** "How many characters would make an all-time TV character list?"

---

### 2. World Building (15% weight)

**What it measures:**
- How fully realized and self-sustaining the show's world feels
- Consistency of rules, institutions, cultures, social structures
- Sense that life exists beyond the immediate story
- Could you navigate this world? Could it support other stories?

**Scoring anchors:**
- **10 = Game of Thrones, The Wire**: The only 10s. Westeros has millennia of history, religions, cultures, languages, economies. Baltimore in The Wire maps every institution.
- **9 = The Expanse, Babylon Berlin**: Exceptional but not quite 10. The Expanse's Earth/Mars/Belt politics are remarkable. Weimar Berlin is astonishing.
- **8.5 = Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire, Rome, The Knick, Andor**: Rich period recreation, fully immersive
- **8 = Mad Men, The Crown, Narcos**: Strong period/milieu work
- **7-7.5 = Most shows**: Good, believable, but not expansive
- **6-6.5 = Intimate dramas**: Six Feet Under, The Bear, Girls—world is backdrop not feature
- **5 = Generic/minimal**: No distinctive world

**Key question:** "Is this world a character in itself? Could I write an encyclopedia about it?"

---

### 3. Cinematography (10% weight)

**What it measures:**
- Visual craft and intentionality
- Framing, camera movement, lighting, color, composition
- Coherence and meaning over surface beauty
- Distinctive visual language

**Key test:** "Could I identify this show from a single frame?"

**Scoring anchors:**
- **10 = True Detective S1, Hannibal, Utopia UK**: Unmistakable visual identity. Every frame is composed with intention.
- **9.5 = The Knick, Mindhunter, Adolescence**: Soderbergh's natural light work; Fincher's precision; single-take mastery
- **9 = Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, Babylon Berlin, Andor**: Distinctive, intentional, recognizable
- **8-8.5 = Most prestige dramas**: Good cinematography, professional, sometimes beautiful
- **7 = Solid but not distinctive**: The Expanse, Homeland, Justified
- **6 = Functional**: The Sopranos, The Wire, The Shield—intentionally unglamorous or dated

**Key question:** "Is the camera telling the story, or just recording it?"

---

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10% weight)

**What it measures:**
- Impact, ambition, and sustained presence of what's shown on screen
- Large-scale environments, production design, VFX
- Novelty and exposure—showing places/worlds/lives rarely seen
- NOT the same as cinematography (how it's shot vs. what's shown)

**Scoring anchors:**
- **10 = Foundation**: Galactic scale, stunning imagery throughout
- **9.5 = Game of Thrones S1-4, House of the Dragon**: Dragons, battles, the Wall, castles at scale
- **9 = Babylon Berlin, Chernobyl, Band of Brothers, Shogun**: Impressive period recreation or spectacle
- **8-8.5 = Rome, Boardwalk Empire, The Expanse, Andor**: Ambitious production design
- **7-7.5 = The Wire, Lost, Stranger Things**: Some memorable imagery, modest scale
- **6 = Breaking Bad, Mr. Robot, Ozark**: Mostly mundane settings with occasional flair
- **5 = Offices, suburbs, homes**: Six Feet Under, The Americans, Girls, The Bear

**Key question:** "Would I pause to admire what's on screen? Have I seen anything like this before?"

---

### 5. Conceptual Density (15% weight)

**What it measures:**
- How many distinct ideas the series meaningfully engages with
- Ideas must be dramatized through story/character, not stated directly
- Breadth of concepts combined with coherent execution
- Political, philosophical, social, moral, institutional ideas all count

**Scoring anchors:**
- **10 = The Wire, Angels in America**: The Wire covers institutions, race, class, education, media, labor, politics—each season adds dimensions. Angels covers AIDS, America, religion, sexuality, politics, mortality.
- **9 = Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, Deadwood, Chernobyl, Dark, Andor, Conceptual Density**: Multiple rich ideas explored from different angles
- **8 = Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mad Men, The Americans**: Focused but deep exploration of 3-4 major themes
- **7 = Succession, Boardwalk Empire, Peaky Blinders**: Present but not profound—one central idea repeated
- **6 = Stranger Things, Downton Abbey**: Entertainment over ideas

**Key question:** "How many college courses could be taught using this show as primary text?"

---

### 6. Narrative Drive (15% weight)

**What it measures:**
- How effectively the story pulls the viewer forward
- Pacing, clarity of stakes, escalation
- Whether each episode meaningfully advances the narrative
- Does NOT require constant action—slow burns can score high if tension is maintained

**Scoring anchors:**
- **10 = Breaking Bad, Chernobyl, Game of Thrones S1-4**: Relentless momentum. Every episode earns the next.
- **9-9.5 = Better Call Saul, The Shield, Band of Brothers, 24, Beef, Severance**: Propulsive, hard to stop watching
- **8-8.5 = Most good dramas**: Compelling forward motion with occasional lulls
- **7-7.5 = The Wire, The Sopranos, Deadwood**: Deliberately slow, demanding, rewarding but tests patience
- **6 = Mad Men, Six Feet Under, Rectify**: Glacial pacing, some seasons drag significantly
- **5 = The Handmaid's Tale (later seasons), Twin Peaks**: Spinning wheels, frustrating lack of progress

**Key question:** "Do I need to watch the next episode, or can I wait?"

---

### 7. Narrative Path & Resolution (15% weight)

**What it measures:**
- How effectively a series fulfills narrative promises it introduces
- Loop management: how many mysteries/arcs opened, carried, closed
- Closure rates and earned payoffs
- Intentional ambiguity is fine; abandoned threads are not

**This category separates great shows from good ones.**

**Scoring anchors:**
- **10 = Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Americans, The Shield, Six Feet Under, Chernobyl, It's a Sin, Adolescence**: Perfect or near-perfect closure. Every thread resolved. Endings enhance everything before.
- **9 = Game of Thrones S1-4, The Sopranos, The Wire, Dark, Band of Brothers, Mr. Robot**: Most arcs resolve meaningfully. Some intentional ambiguity that works.
- **8 = Mad Men, Fargo, The Leftovers, Succession**: Solid endings, most threads tied, minor quibbles
- **7 = Ozark, The Expanse, Boardwalk Empire, Peaky Blinders**: Decent endings but rushed, uneven, or incomplete
- **6 = Deadwood, The Knick, Rome, House of the Dragon, Severance, Andor**: Cancelled or ongoing—can't fully judge yet
- **5 = Lost, Mindhunter, Yellowjackets, The Handmaid's Tale, Foundation**: Mystery boxes without payoff, abandoned threads, spinning wheels

**Key question:** "Did the show earn its ending? Were promises kept?"

## EPISODE MULTIPLIER

Rewards sustained excellence over longer runs.

| Episodes | Multiplier | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Miniseries | ×0.96 | Chernobyl, Band of Brothers, True Detective S1 |
| 10-20 | ×0.95 | Severance, Andor, Shogun |
| 21-30 | ×0.97 | The Leftovers, Dark |
| 31-40 | ×1.00 | Deadwood, Succession, Halt and Catch Fire |
| 41-50 | ×1.02 | Ozark, Mr. Robot |
| 51-60 | ×1.03 | Boardwalk Empire, Fargo, The Handmaid's Tale |
| 61-75 | ×1.04 | Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Wire, Girls |
| 76-100 | ×1.05 | The Sopranos, The Americans, The Shield, Mad Men |
| 100+ | ×1.06 | Lost, 24, Homicide |

**Miniseries note:** A miniseries is a self-contained story designed to be that length. It gets ×0.96 regardless of episode count (5-10 typically). Examples: Chernobyl (5), Band of Brothers (10), True Detective S1 (8), Angels in America (6).

## SCORING PROCESS

### Step 1: Score each category (use decimals like 7.5, 8.5)

For each category, ask the key question and compare to anchors. Be strict:
- 9+ is rare (99% perfect in that category)
- 8 is exceptional
- 7 is very good
- 5-6 is average to good
- Don't give 9s freely

### Step 2: Calculate base score

```
Base = (Char × 0.20) + (World × 0.15) + (Cine × 0.10) + (Spect × 0.10) + (Conc × 0.15) + (Drive × 0.15) + (Resol × 0.15)
```

### Step 3: Apply episode multiplier

```
Final = Base × Multiplier
```

### Step 4: Sanity check

Compare to similar shows in the existing list. Does the ranking make sense? If a show scores 8.5 but feels worse than shows at 8.0, re-examine the scores.

---

## EDGE CASES

### Ongoing shows (Severance, House of the Dragon, Silo)
- Score Resolution conservatively (usually 6-7)
- These shows can move up significantly once they conclude

### Cancelled shows (Deadwood, The Knick, Mindhunter)
- Resolution capped around 6 unless final season provides closure
- Don't punish the show for external factors, but acknowledge incompleteness

### Anthology series (Fargo, True Detective, Black Mirror)
- Score the series as a whole, averaging across seasons
- If one season is transcendent and others weak, note it but average

### Shows that collapse (Dexter, Game of Thrones full run, The Walking Dead)
- Option 1: Score best seasons only (e.g., "Game of Thrones S1-4")
- Option 2: Score full run with Resolution penalty
- Note which approach is used

### Limited series vs. ongoing
- A show marketed as limited/miniseries gets miniseries multiplier
- A show that got cancelled after one season is NOT a miniseries

## EXAMPLE SCORING: How to Score a New Show

### Example: "Pachinko" (16 eps, ongoing → ×0.95)

**Characters & Acting: 8.5**
- Sunja across generations is extraordinary. Minha Kim and Youn Yuh-jung both remarkable.
- Solomon less compelling. Supporting cast strong.
- Compared to anchors: Better than Mad Men (8), not quite Succession (9)

**World Building: 8.5**
- Korea under Japanese occupation, 1980s Japan, immigrant experience
- Rich cultural/historical detail
- Not quite Babylon Berlin (9) but close

**Cinematography: 9**
- Kogonada's distinctive style. Beautiful compositions.
- Recognizable from a frame.

**Visual Spectacle: 8**
- Period Korea, Osaka, the markets, the pachinko parlors
- Impressive production design

**Conceptual Density: 8**
- Colonialism, immigration, identity, family, sacrifice, assimilation
- Multiple ideas explored across generations

**Narrative Drive: 7**
- Beautiful but slow. Literary pacing.
- Some episodes meander

**Narrative Path & Resolution: 6**
- Ongoing. Story incomplete.
- Can't judge yet

**Calculation:**
Base = (8.5 × 0.20) + (8.5 × 0.15) + (9 × 0.10) + (8 × 0.10) + (8 × 0.15) + (7 × 0.15) + (6 × 0.15)
Base = 1.70 + 1.275 + 0.90 + 0.80 + 1.20 + 1.05 + 0.90 = 7.825

Final = 7.825 × 0.95 = **7.43**

This would place Pachinko around #55-60, near Borgen, Pose, Squid Game. That feels right for an excellent but ongoing show.

## ADDING TO THE LIST

When scoring a new show:
1. Score all 7 categories with reasoning
2. Calculate base and final scores
3. Compare to existing shows at similar scores—does it feel right?
4. Insert into ranked list at appropriate position
5. Note if show is ongoing (score may change when concluded)

---

## SHOWS NOT YET SCORED (Candidates)

These shows could be added to the list:
- Pachinko
- Ripley
- Shōgun (if treated as ongoing vs. miniseries)
- The Gentlemen
- 3 Body Problem
- Presumed Innocent
- The Day of the Jackal
- Reacher
- Slow Horses (currently unscored)
- The Diplomat
- Black Doves
- Disclaimer
- The Gilded Age
- Perry Mason (2020)
- Winning Time
- We Own This City
- Mare of Easttown (verify current score)

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Be consistent.** The value of this system is comparability. Always check new scores against anchors.

**Be strict.** 9s are rare. 10s are nearly impossible. Most shows should cluster 7-8.

**Resolution matters.** This is what separates good from great. A show that doesn't stick the landing cannot be elite.

**Trust the math.** If a show's calculated score doesn't feel right, re-examine category scores rather than fudging the final number.

**Update ongoing shows.** When a show concludes, rescore Resolution and recalculate.
