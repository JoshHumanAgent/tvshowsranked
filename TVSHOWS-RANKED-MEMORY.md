## ⚡ THE 7 CATEGORIES (Weighted)

| Category | Weight | Core Question |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Characters & Acting** | 20% | Do they feel real? Agency + Interiority + Mystery |
| **World Building** | 15% | Is the world fully realized? Consistent rules, life beyond plot? |
| **Cinematography** | 10% | Visual craft - framing, lighting, composition. Recognizable frame? |
| **Visual Spectacle** | 10% | Novelty of what's shown. Everyday (5) vs unprecedented (10)? |
| **Conceptual Density** | 15% | How many distinct ideas meaningfully engaged? |
| **Narrative Drive** | 15% | Pacing, stakes, compulsion. Does each episode advance? |
| **Narrative Path & Resolution** | 15% | Earned payoffs, closure, no cheap reversals. Does it stick landing? |

## 📊 THE SCALE (Strict Discipline)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Average - competent, nothing special (most TV) |
| 6 | Good - noticeably better |
| 7 | Very good - memorable, stands out |
| 8 | Exceptional - among best in class |
| 9 | Incredible - 99% perfect, minor flaws only |
| 10 | Perfect - literally impossible to improve |

**Anchor calibration:** Use Breaking Bad (8.89) and Game of Thrones S1-4 (9.50) as reference points.

## 🎭 CHARACTERS - THE FOUR TESTS

A high-scoring character must have:
1. **Agency** - Choices feel authentically theirs, not plot-driven
2. **Interiority** - Rich inner life, feel real when camera's off
3. **Productive Mystery** - You wonder about them (not confusion, genuine curiosity)
4. **Coherent Complexity** - Contradictions make human sense (Kim Wexler archetype)

**Ensemble breadth matters.** 5-6 exceptional characters > 1 great lead.

## 🎬 VISUAL SPECTACLE vs CINEMATOGRAPHY

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
- **Cinematography** = HOW it's shot (Breaking Bad desert = 9)
- **Visual Spectacle** = WHAT is shown (suburban houses, parking lots = 6)

**Visual Spectacle Scale:**
- 5 = Offices, homes, streets (everyday)
- 6-7 = Period settings, good production design
- 8 = Large practical sets, memorable VFX
- 9-10 = Unprecedented, iconic, pause-to-admire

## 🔢 EPISODE MULTIPLIER

| Episodes | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| Miniseries | ×0.96 |
| 10-20 | ×0.95 |
| 21-30 | ×0.97 |
| 31-40 | ×1.00 |
| 41-50 | ×1.02 |
| 51-60 | ×1.03 |
| 61-75 | ×1.04 |
| 76-100 | ×1.05 |
| 100+ | ×1.06 |

Longer shows must maintain quality. Sustained excellence is harder.

## 🧠 QUICK ANCHOR REFERENCE

| Show | Final | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Game of Thrones S1-4 | 9.50 | Peak spectacle + world-building + narrative |
| Breaking Bad | 8.89 | Character perfection, 10/10 gravitas/drive |
| The Wire | 8.74 | 10/10 world-building + themes, slow burn |
| Chernobyl | 8.54 | Miniseries perfection, 10/10 gravitas |
| The Sopranos | 8.38 | Invented prestige TV grammar |

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Don't inflate scores.** 5 = average, most TV lives here.
2. **Separate Cinematography from Spectacle.** Beautiful shots of houses ≠ spectacle.
3. **Recency bias is real.** Compare against anchors, not last show watched.
4. **Resolution matters.** A show that sticks the landing > one that collapses.
5. **Productive mystery > explained.** Kim Wexler's ambiguity > stated motives.

## 🎯 AUTOMATED RANKING CHECKLIST

When evaluating a new show:

```
□ Score all 7 categories (use decimals if needed: 7.5, 8.5)
□ Apply weights → base score
□ Count episodes → apply multiplier
□ Verify against anchors (is this better/worse than Breaking Bad's X?)
□ Round to 2 decimals for final
□ Insert into ranked list
□ Update website (top 100 displayed)
```

**Backlog rule:** Website always shows 100. When filtering (e.g., 2000s), show top 100 from that slice. Need 200+ total ranked for meaningful filters.
