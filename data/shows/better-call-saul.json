    "consensus_highlights": "Better Call Saul transcended its origins as a Breaking Bad prequel to become its own masterpiece. The series charts Jimmy McGill's transformation into Saul Goodman with patience and psychological depth that rivals its predecessor. Bob Odenkirk delivers a career-defining performance, while Jonathan Banks provides emotional weight as Mike Ehrmantraut. The visual storytelling and attention to detail set a new standard for television.",
