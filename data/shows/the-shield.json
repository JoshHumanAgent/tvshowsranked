    "consensus_highlights": "The Shield is a gritty police drama that broke new ground with its unflinching portrayal of corrupt cops in Los Angeles' Farmington District. Michael Chiklis delivers a powerhouse performance as Vic Mackey, the charismatic yet morally bankrupt strike team leader. The series pioneered the antihero cop drama and maintained its intensity throughout seven seasons.",
