                <h2>Denny Crane</h2>
                <p>Boston Legal is a comedy-drama that takes its comedy seriously and its drama comedically. William Shatner's Denny Crane—mad, brilliant, declining—is one of television's great characters. James Spader's Alan Shore is his perfect foil: morally flexible, verbally dazzling, profoundly lonely.</p>
                
                <h3>The Shatner Renaissance</h3>
                <p>Before Boston Legal, Shatner was a punchline. After Denny Crane, he was an icon. The role won him Emmys and Golden Globes, and deserved them all. Denny Crane is a legendary attorney losing his mind while staying sharp enough to win cases. It's tragedy played as farce, and Shatner understood the balance perfectly.</p>
                
                <h3>David E. Kelley</h3>
                <p>Kelley's legal shows (The Practice, Ally McBeal, Boston Legal) share a sensibility: cases as moral parables, characters as eccentrics, dialogue as theatrical performance. Boston Legal leans furthest into absurdity, allowing speeches that would get real lawyers disbarred and monologues that run minutes without interruption.</p>
                
                <h3>The Balance</h3>
                <p>The show's genius is letting high drama and low comedy coexist. One episode tackles capital punishment; the next features Denny Crane shooting a client. The conceptual density score reflects a show that can discuss constitutional law while a character dances in his underwear. It's not inconsistent—it's American legal theater.</p>
                
                <h3>The Ending</h3>
                <p>Five seasons, 101 episodes, a proper finale that marries the two leads (literally, for insurance purposes). The resolution score reflects a show that knew when to end and how to say goodbye.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Shatner and Spader at their peak. Television's most entertaining law firm.</p>
