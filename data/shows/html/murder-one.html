                <h2>One Case, Twenty-Two Episodes</h2>
                <p>Before The People v. O.J. Simpson, before Making a Murderer, there was Murder One. Steven Bochco's revolutionary legal drama followed a single murder trial across an entire season. In 1995, that was radical. Today, it's the standard for prestige television.</p>
                
                <h3>Theodore Hoffman</h3>
                <p>Daniel Benzali's defense attorney is television's most compelling lawyer—not because he's brilliant (though he is), but because he's tired. Hoffman carries the weight of every case, every moral compromise, every client he knows is guilty but defends anyway. His bald head and deep voice became iconic.</p>
                
                <h3>The Format</h3>
                <p>Season one follows one case: a wealthy novelist accused of murdering a 15-year-old girl. Every episode reveals new evidence, new witnesses, new complications. The conceptual density score reflects a show that trusts its audience to remember details and follow complex legal proceedings.</p>
                
                <h3>Season Two</h3>
                <p>Benzali left after season one. ABC panicked, retooled the show around a younger, more conventional lead. The quality dropped. The resolution score reflects a show that peaked in its first season and never recovered. But that first season? flawless.</p>
                
                <h3>Stanley Tucci</h3>
                <p>Before he was an Oscar nominee, Tucci played Richard Cross—a charming, wealthy, possibly guilty sociopath. It's a masterclass in ambiguity: you never know if Cross is innocent or just very good at pretending.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Season one invented modern prestige TV. Season two proved why the formula was perfect.</p>
