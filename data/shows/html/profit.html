                <h2>The Anti-Hero Before Anti-Heroes</h2>
                <p>Before Tony Soprano, before Don Draper, before Walter White, there was Jim Profit. Fox cancelled it after four episodes. Critics called it unwatchable. Advertisers fled. And yet—and yet—Profit may be the most ambitious network drama of the 1990s.</p>
                
                <h3>Jim Profit</h3>
                <p>Adrian Pasdar plays a corporate sociopath who was raised in a cardboard box with the television on 24/7. He climbed out, educated himself, and now he's clawing his way up the corporate ladder by any means necessary. Profit will seduce, blackmail, and murder to win. He talks to the camera, breaking the fourth wall to explain his philosophy: "The truth is a lie."</p>
                
                <h3>Corporate Evil</h3>
                <p>The conceptual density score reflects a show that understood corporate amorality before The Wolf of Wall Street made it entertainment. Profit isn't just cynical about business—it sees capitalism as a system that rewards sociopathy. In 1996, that was too radical for network television.</p>
                
                <h3>The Cancellation</h3>
                <p>Fox aired four episodes before advertiser pressure killed it. The remaining four episodes aired overseas or floated on the internet for years. The resolution score reflects an incomplete vision—but eight episodes is enough for a complete character study.</p>
                
                <h3>The Legacy</h3>
                <p>Profit predicted the anti-hero boom by nearly a decade. Every cable drama that followed owes something to Jim Profit's willingness to be hated. The show failed because it was ahead of its time. That's the best kind of failure.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The show that was too dark for 1996. Perfect for right now.</p>
