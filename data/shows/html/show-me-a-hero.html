                <h2>Housing, Politics, and the American City</h2>
                <p>David Simon's miniseries about the Yonkers housing crisis of the 1980s isn't entertainment—it's civic education disguised as drama. Six hours about where people live and why it matters, anchored by Oscar Isaac as the young mayor forced to implement federally mandated public housing.</p>
                
                <h3>Wasicsko's Tragedy</h3>
                <p>Nick Wasicsko was 28 when he became mayor of Yonkers, elected on a promise to fight court-ordered desegregation. When the courts won, he became the man who had to implement what he campaigned against. Isaac plays him as a tragic figure—someone who does the right thing and is destroyed for it.</p>
                
                <h3>The System View</h3>
                <p>Simon's trademark is showing how institutions grind people. We see the white homeowners who legitimately fear for their property values. We see the Black residents who've been systematically excluded from opportunity. We see politicians trapped between constituencies. No one is evil; everyone is trapped.</p>
                
                <h3>Why It's Not Higher</h3>
                <p>For all its excellence, Show Me a Hero is homework. It's important, illuminating, beautifully acted—but it's not compulsively watchable. The pacing is deliberate, the subject matter dry, the emotional payoffs muted. This is television as education, not television as addictive entertainment.</p>
                
                <h3>The Catharine Carson Thread</h3>
                <p>Carla Quevedo plays a character who represents the human cost of policy—driven from her home by the very housing projects meant to help. Her story reminds us that even well-intentioned policy has victims.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best civics lesson on television. Essential viewing for understanding American cities.</p>
