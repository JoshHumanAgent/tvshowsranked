                <h2>Podcast Noir</h2>
                <p>Only Murders in the Building is comfort food murder mystery—a cozy whodunit about three neighbors who start a true crime podcast while investigating a death in their upscale Manhattan apartment building. Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez have chemistry that shouldn't work but absolutely does.</p>
                
                <h3>Three Generations, One Obsession</h3>
                <p>The show's engine is the dynamic between Charles-Haden Savage (Martin), a retired actor; Oliver Putnam (Short), a financially ruined theater director; and Mabel Mora (Gomez), a young artist with secrets. They share nothing in common except an obsession with true crime and a building where someone was murdered. The generational clash is played for laughs but reveals genuine connection.</p>
                
                <h3>Meta on Meta on Meta</h3>
                <p>Only Murders loves its layers. The characters make a podcast about a murder they're investigating, we watch them make the podcast, and the podcast becomes evidence in the case. Later seasons add more metatextual elements—celebrity guest stars playing themselves, Hollywood adaptations, podcast competitions. It's clever without being exhausting.</p>
                
                <h3>The Cozy Problem</h3>
                <p>The show's coziness is both its appeal and its limitation. Stakes are never too high, bodies are never too messy, resolutions are never too dark. For viewers seeking comfort, it's perfect. For viewers seeking the edge of better mystery series, it may feel slight. The #100 ranking reflects this—it's excellent at what it does, but what it does has limits.</p>
                
                <h3>Why It Works</h3>
                <p>Martin and Short have been performing together for decades, and their timing is flawless. Gomez provides the cynical counterweight to their old-man-energy. The mysteries are fair-play whodunits—clues are planted, red herrings are laid, and the solution makes sense in retrospect. It's television as pleasure, not challenge.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Delightful comfort TV. Not aiming for greatness, achieving goodness consistently.</p>
