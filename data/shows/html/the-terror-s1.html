                <h2>Arctic Horror Perfected</h2>
                <p>The Terror's first season is a masterwork of atmospheric horror—The Thing meets Master and Commander, with a supernatural threat that's barely glimpsed because the real terror is isolation, cold, and the slow unraveling of civilization. Based on Dan Simmons' novel about the lost Franklin Expedition, it transforms historical tragedy into something primal.</p>
                
                <h3>The Cold That Kills</h3>
                <p>In 1845, two Royal Navy ships—HMS Erebus and HMS Terror—vanished while searching for the Northwest Passage. The series imagines what happened to them with grim inevitability. Ice traps the ships. Food runs low. Scurvy sets in. And something is out there on the ice, something that hunts men and wears their faces.</p>
                
                <h3>Two Captains, Two Philosophies</h3>
                <p>Jared Harris as Captain Francis Crozier is a marvel—drunk, competent, and increasingly绝望 as he realizes the expedition is doomed. Tobias Menzies as James Fitzjames provides the British naval officer contrast: all bravado and blind faith in empire. Their relationship evolves from antagonism to mutual respect as survival strips away pretense.</p>
                
                <h3>Horror in the White</h3>
                <p>The show's genius is understanding that isolation is terrifying enough. The Tuunbaq—the supernatural predator stalking the crew—is almost incidental. More frightening is the lead poisoning, the mutiny, the decision to split up and walk toward an impossible rescue. The final episodes are among the bleakest television has ever produced.</p>
                
                <h3>Anthology Note</h3>
                <p>Only Season 1 ranks here. The second season, subtitled Infamy, is a Japanese internment camp ghost story—a different show with different strengths. The Terror works as an anthology, but the first season stands as a complete, perfect narrative.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Ten episodes of mounting dread. A survival horror masterpiece.</p>
