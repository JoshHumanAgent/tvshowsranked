                <h2>X-Files for the Demonic Age</h2>
                <p>Evil is what happens when The X-Files meets Catholic demonology. A skeptical psychologist, a priest-in-training, and a contractor investigate supernatural phenomena for the Catholic Church. Each week: is it mental illness or is it demons? More often than expected, the answer is demons.</p>
                
                <h3>The Core Trio</h3>
                <p>Katja Herbers plays Kristen, the psychologist whose rationality is constantly challenged. Mike Colter is David, the priest battling his own demons (literal and metaphorical). Aasif Mandvi rounds out the trio as Ben, the contractor who applies scientific rigor to the unexplainable. Their chemistry keeps the procedural fresh.</p>
                
                <h3>Radical Ambiguity (Eventually Resolved)</h3>
                <p>The show's early strength is its ambiguity—each case could be psychological or supernatural. But as seasons progress, Evil commits to its supernatural elements. By season three, there's no question: demons are real, possession happens, and the Catholic Church is fighting a literal war.</p>
                
                <h3>Robert and Michelle King</h3>
                <p>The creators of The Good Wife bring unexpected sophistication to what could be generic horror. The writing is sharp, the cases inventive, and the overarching mythology surprisingly coherent. This is network television with cable ambitions.</p>
                
                <h3>The Ongoing Problem</h3>
                <p>The resolution score reflects a show still in progress. The mythology keeps expanding without clear endpoints. What began as case-of-the-week has become an extended meditation on evil's nature—but where it's heading remains unclear.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best network horror in years. X-Files for the possession generation.</p>
