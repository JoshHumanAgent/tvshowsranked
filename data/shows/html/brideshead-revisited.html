                <h2>The Divine and the Damned</h2>
                <p>Brideshead Revisited is about a Catholic family's fall from grace, told through the eyes of an outsider who wants in. Charles Ryder falls in love with the Flytes—their castle, their world, their faith—and watches everything crumble. Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews star in what remains the definitive period drama.</p>
                
                <h3>Oxford and After</h3>
                <p>The first episodes capture Oxford between the wars—bicycles, punts, aesthetes, and innocence. Charles meets Sebastian Flyte carrying a teddy bear and falls under the spell of Brideshead Castle. The world building score reflects one of television's most fully realized environments—every room, every garden, every shadow means something.</p>
                
                <h3>Catholic Guilt</h3>
                <p>The conceptual density score captures Waugh's central theme: the Flytes are doomed by their Catholicism, but also saved by it. The faith that tortures them is also the only thing that matters. Religious viewers and atheists read the ending differently—a rare achievement.</p>
                
                <h3>The Cast</h3>
                <p>Jeremy Irons as Charles, a middle-class observer; Anthony Andrews as Sebastian, the beautiful drunk; Diana Quick as Julia, the sister Charles loves; Laurence Olivier as Lord Marchmain, the apostate father dying abroad. The character acting score reflects an ensemble without weak links.</p>
                
                <h3>The Decline</h3>
                <p>Brideshead isn't just a house; it's an era. The resolution score acknowledges a story about loss—of faith, of class, of certainty. Charles enters a Catholic world he doesn't understand and leaves it changed, even if he never believes.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The most beautiful television ever made about faith, class, and watching things end.</p>
