                <h2>Who Killed Laura Palmer?</h2>
                <p>Before there was prestige television, there was Twin Peaks. David Lynch and Mark Frost's creation didn't just break the rules—it pretended rules didn't exist. A small-town murder mystery became a portal into surrealism, soap opera parody, and the darkness lurking beneath Americannormalcy. Thirty years later, its influence is everywhere.</p>
                
                <h3>The Dream Logic</h3>
                <p>Twin Peaks operates on dream logic. Characters speak in non sequiturs, time moves strangely, and a dancing dwarf might appear in a vision to deliver crucial information. The famous Red Room sequence—with Agent Cooper encountering the Man from Another Place—set a template for television surrealism that shows still copy. Nothing is explained; everything means something.</p>
                
                <h3>Dale Cooper, Beautiful Weirdo</h3>
                <p>Kyle MacLachlan's FBI agent is television's most endearing protagonist. Cooper loves cherry pie, records dictation to his never-seen secretary Diane, and approaches the supernatural with scientific rigor. He's absurd and completely sincere—the show's way of saying that weirdness and goodness aren't opposites.</p>
                
                <h3>The Problem with Season Two</h3>
                <p>ABC demanded Lynch reveal Laura's killer, destroying the show's central mystery. Once revealed, the show floundered, introducing subplots (James Hurley's motorcycle adventures, anyone?) that ranged from boring to bizarre. The score reflects this—season two's midsection is a masterclass in how network interference can damage art. But the finale returns to form, ending on a cliffhanger that haunted viewers for 25 years.</p>
                
                <h3>The Legacy</h3>
                <p>Every weird show on television owes something to Twin Peaks. The X-Files, Lost, The Return, Legion—they're all descendants. Lynch proved that television could be art, that a medium built for advertising could house poetry. The 2017 revival (The Return) is even better than the original, but it depends on this foundation.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The original weird TV. Flawed, influential, absolutely essential.</p>
