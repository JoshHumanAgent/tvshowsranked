                <h2>Season One is Perfect</h2>
                <p>True Detective is two shows. Season one, directed entirely by Cary Joji Fukunaga and starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, is among the greatest seasons of television ever made. Seasons two through four vary in quality. This review reflects the whole—but season one alone would rank higher.</p>
                
                <h3>Rust Cohle</h3>
                <p>McConaughey's Rustin Cohle is television philosophy given form—a pessimist, a nihilist, a detective who sees time as a flat circle. His monologues about meaning and meaninglessness became instant memes, but they're also genuinely profound. "I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming." This is detective fiction as existential crisis.</p>
                
                <h3>Louisiana Gothic</h3>
                <p>The setting is character. Southern Louisiana's bayous, refineries, and trailer parks create an atmosphere of rot and redemption. The yellow king, the spiral symbols, the ritual murders—True Detective borrows from weird fiction (particularly Robert W. Chambers) to create something genuinely unsettling, not just violent.</p>
                
                <h3>The Tracking Shot</h3>
                <p>Episode four's six-minute tracking shot through a housing project raid is legendary, but Fukunaga's direction elevates every frame. This is television with cinematic ambition—and it shows. The cinematography score reflects a show that looks better than most films.</p>
                
                <h3>The Other Seasons</h3>
                <p>Season two is a mess—overcomplicated noir that collapses under its own pretension. Season three recovers with strong performances but never matches season one's intensity. Season four (Night Country) divides critics. The resolution score reflects inconsistency: season one ends perfectly, the others struggle.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Watch season one. It's a complete masterpiece. The rest is optional.</p>
