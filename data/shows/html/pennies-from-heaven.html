                <h2>Before The Singing Detective</h2>
                <p>Pennies from Heaven is Dennis Potter's first major use of popular songs to reveal psychological truth. Bob Hoskins plays Arthur Parker, a sheet music salesman in 1930s England who dreams of better things. When characters break into lip-synced musical numbers, they're not performing—they're expressing desires they can't articulate.</p>
                
                <h3>The Potter Formula</h3>
                <p>Everything that makes The Singing Detective great is here, just slightly less refined. The conceptual density score reflects Potter's signature complexity: depression-era England, sexual frustration, class anxiety, and the gap between popular art and lived reality. Characters lip-sync to cheery songs while their lives fall apart.</p>
                
                <h3>Bob Hoskins</h3>
                <p>Before he was a movie star, Hoskins was Arthur Parker—a desperate, charming, ultimately tragic dreamer. The character acting score reflects a performance that should have made him a household name. He's pathetic and magnetic simultaneously.</p>
                
                <h3>The Controversy</h3>
                <p>When it aired, Pennies from Heaven was controversial for its sexual content and dark vision. The BBC received complaints. Critics were divided. History has vindicated it. The resolution score reflects an ending that's painful but perfect—Potter never lets his characters escape their choices.</p>
                
                <h3>The Connection</h3>
                <p>Watch Pennies from Heaven, then The Singing Detective. You'll see Potter refining his technique. The Singing Detective is better, but Pennies from Heaven is essential for understanding how it came to be.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The prototype for The Singing Detective. Potter discovers his formula.</p>
