                <h2>Time Travel Done Right</h2>
                <p>Based on Terry Gilliam's film, 12 Monkeys expands the premise into four seasons of intricate time-travel mechanics, paradoxes that actually make sense, and emotional stakes that build across decades. It's the rare adaptation that surpasses its source material.</p>
                
                <h3>The Premise Expanded</h3>
                <p>A time traveler from 2043 arrives in 2015 to stop a plague that will wipe out most of humanity. The film told this story in two hours; the series gets 47 episodes to explore implications, create paradoxes, and build a mythology around fate versus free will.</p>
                
                <h3>Cole and Cassie</h3>
                <p>Aaron Stanford and Amanda Schull have chemistry that carries the show through its densest plotting. Their relationship spans timelines, realities, and multiple versions of themselves. The show never loses sight that time travel is meaningless unless we care about who's traveling.</p>
                
                <h3>Actually Logical</h3>
                <p>Most time-travel stories collapse under scrutiny. 12 Monkeys commits to its rules and follows them. Paradoxes have consequences. Changing the past creates new timelines. The show's writers clearly planned ahead—foreshadowing in season one pays off in season four.</p>
                
                <h3>Complete Story</h3>
                <p>The resolution score reflects a rare achievement: the show ended on its own terms with a conclusion that honors everything that came before. Not every mystery is explained, but every character arc is completed. In the era of cancelled shows, completeness matters.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Time travel that rewards attention. The adaptation that exceeded expectations.</p>
