                <h2>Kate Winslet's Masterclass</h2>
                <p>Todd Haynes' adaptation of James M. Cain's novel is five hours of slow-burn domestic horror—a woman's struggle to build a life for herself and her daughters during the Great Depression, and the daughter who becomes her destruction. It's not the noir of the 1945 film; it's something more intimate and devastating.</p>
                
                <h3>A Mother's Love, A Daughter's Poison</h3>
                <p>Mildred's relationship with Veda is the show's engine. Veda (Evan Rachel Wood) is spoiled, ungrateful, and pathologically cruel—but Mildred can't stop loving her. The miniseries captures how family can be a trap, how parenting can be performance, how success means nothing if your children despise you.</p>
                
                <h3>The Depression as Character</h3>
                <p>Haynes renders 1930s Los Angeles with obsessive detail—the dust, the desperation, the way restaurant work becomes both opportunity and humiliation. Mildred's rise from unemployed divorcée to restaurant mogul is both triumph and trap.</p>
                
                <h3>The Men in Her Life</h3>
                <p>Guy Pearce's Monty Beragon is charming, useless, and ultimately destructive—but Mildred loves him anyway. The show's thesis is that love is the problem. Mildred loves the wrong people for the wrong reasons, and her reasonable instincts are constantly overridden by emotional needs she can't control.</p>
                
                <h3>Slow Television</h3>
                <p>The narrative drive score reflects the deliberate pace. This isn't a thriller—it's a character study that accumulates weight over hours. Some viewers found it glacial. Others found the patience itself meaningful. The ranking reflects a show that delivers exactly what it promises, but what it promises isn't for everyone.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Prestige television at its most patient. Winslet is devastating.</p>
