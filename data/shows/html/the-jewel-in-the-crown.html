                <h2>The End of Empire</h2>
                <p>The Jewel in the Crown is about the last days of British India—the racism, the violence, the slow-motion collapse of an empire. Based on Paul Scott's Raj Quartet, it follows the aftermath of one crime through the lives of dozens of characters, Indians and British, from 1942 to independence.</p>
                
                <h3>The Rape of Daphne Manners</h3>
                <p>The series begins with a crime that echoes through everything that follows. But the real subject is what the British did to India—and what India did back. The conceptual density score reflects a story about empire, race, loyalty, and betrayal that never simplifies.</p>
                
                <h3>The World</h3>
                <p>The world building score is maximum because this India feels completely real. The clubs, the prisons, the railways, the politics—the production created a comprehensive vision of the Raj at its end. You understand why the British stayed and why they had to leave.</p>
                
                <h3>Merrison and Pembridge</h3>
                <p>Timothy Piggott-Smith as Ronald Merrick—the police officer whose ambition and prejudice destroy everything he touches. Susan Wooldridge as Daphne Manners, whose rape is never quite what it seems. The character score reflects performances that defined careers.</p>
                
                <h3>Independence</h3>
                <p>The resolution acknowledges partition—the violence that accompanied independence. This isn't a story about noble British exit; it's about chaos, cruelty, and the price of empire. The series doesn't flinch.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The greatest drama about British India ever made. Empire in its final, honest light.</p>
