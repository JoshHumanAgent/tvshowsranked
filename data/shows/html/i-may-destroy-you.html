                <h2> Consent, Trauma, and the Memory</h2>
                <p>Michaela Coel wrote, directed, and starred in this singular exploration of sexual assault—and in doing so, created one of the most important television shows of the 2020s. I May Destroy You isn't just about rape; it's about memory, friendship, and the impossible task of processing trauma when you can't trust your ownmind.</p>
                
                <h3> Arabella</h3>
                <p>Coel's Arabella Essiedu is a Twitter-famous writer whose night out ends with her drink spiked and her memory fractured. The show's genius is in how it depicts the aftermath—not as a simple narrative of victimization and justice, but as a labyrinth of confusion, denial, rage, and eventually, a kind of peace that isn't healing but is something like survival.</p>
                
                <h3> The Structure</h3>
                <p>I May Destroy You plays with form in ways that honor the psychological experience of trauma. Time loops, alternate endings, fantasy sequences—these aren't stylistic flourishes but attempts to represent the way trauma fractures experience. Coel refuses to give the viewer easy catharsis because there is no easy catharsis.</p>
                
                <h3> The Friends</h3>
                <p>The friendship between Arabella, Terry (Weruche Opia), and Kwame (Paapa Essiedu) is the show's emotional center. They're not perfect allies—sometimes they fail each other—but their loyalty provides the ground from which Arabella can begin to rebuild. The depiction of Black friendship in London is specific, warm, and essential to the show's power.</p>
                
                <h3> The Ending</h3>
                <p>The final episode offers multiple endings—different ways Arabella might process what happened to her. None of them are the "right" one. The point is that healing isn't linear and there's no correct way to survive. It's one of television's most profound conclusions.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Essential. Coel's vision is singular, necessary, and unforgettable.</p>
