                <h2>The Golden Age of Westeros</h2>
                <p>Game of Thrones seasons 1-4 represents perhaps the greatest run of television in the medium's history. This is the complete package: George R.R. Martin's intricate political machinations brought to life by showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss at the height of their creative powers, with an ensemble cast that would define prestige television for a decade.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Seasons 1-4?</h3>
                <p>We score this specifically as seasons 1-4 because that's where the show earned its legacy. Season 1 established the world and delivered the shocking death of Ned Stark—a moment that fundamentally changed television. Season 2 gave us the Battle of Blackwater. Season 3 delivered the Red Wedding, perhaps the most discussed episode in TV history. Season 4 concluded with the death of Tywin Lannister and the emergence of the show's major players as forces to be reckoned with.</p>
                
                <p>After season 4, the show began its decline—running out of book material, prioritizing spectacle over character logic, and ultimately delivering one of the most disappointing final seasons in television history. But seasons 1-4? That's a masterpiece.</p>
                
                <h3>The Characters</h3>
                <p>Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister became the voice of the show—witty, morally complex, and endlessly watchable. Lena Headey's Cersei was a villain you understood. Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington grew into their roles as Daenerys and Jon Snow. The supporting cast—from Maisie Williams' Arya to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's Jaime—delivered performances that elevated every scene they were in.</p>
                
                <h3>The World</h3>
                <p>Westeros is television's most fully realized fantasy world. The Seven Kingdoms, the Wall, the Free Cities, the Dothraki Sea—each location felt distinct, lived-in, and essential. The political system, the religions, the history—it all mattered. No show has ever built a world this detailed and made it feel this real.</p>
                
                <h3>Legacy</h3>
                <p>Game of Thrones proved that television could do what cinema couldn't—tell a massive, sprawling story with dozens of characters across multiple continents, sustained over years. It raised the bar for production values, for writing, for what audiences would accept. Every fantasy series since exists in its shadow.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best television ever made—before it fell apart. Seasons 1-4 are unimpeachable.</p>
