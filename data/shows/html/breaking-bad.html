                <h2>The Perfect Breaking Point</h2>
                <p>Breaking Bad is often cited as the greatest television series ever made—and the argument is compelling. Vince Gilligan's masterpiece takes a simple premise—a high school chemistry teacher with cancer turns to cooking meth—and transforms it into a Shakespearean tragedy about pride, ego, and the corrupting nature of power.</p>
                
                <h3>The Transformation</h3>
                <p>What makes Breaking Bad extraordinary is its commitment to Walter White's transformation. This isn't a hero's journey—it's a villain's origin story. We watch Mr. White become Heisenberg, and the brilliance is in how the show makes us complicit. We root for him long after we should stop. We understand hisjustifications even as we recognize them as lies.</p>
                
                <h3>Bryan Cranston's Masterclass</h3>
                <p>Bryan Cranston's performance is the stuff of legend. In four seasons, he went from a sitcom dad to delivering one of the most complex dramatic performances in television history. His Walter White is pathetic, terrifying, brilliant, and pathetic again—sometimes within the same scene. Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman provided the moral heart of the show, and their relationship gave Breaking Bad its emotional core.</p>
                
                <h3>Resolution Perfection</h3>
                <p>Breaking Bad gets full marks for resolution because it stuck the landing. "Felina" is widely considered one of the greatest series finales ever—a satisfying conclusion that tied up every thread while remaining true to the show's themes. Few shows finish this well. Breaking Bad did.</p>
                
                <h3>The Albuquerque Aesthetic</h3>
                <p>The New Mexico desert became a character itself—the bleaching sun, the vast emptiness, the beauty and menace of the landscape. This was television that looked like cinema, with visual storytelling that trusted the audience to read the frame.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> A perfect five-season arc with a perfect ending. Television's answer to Greek tragedy.</p>
