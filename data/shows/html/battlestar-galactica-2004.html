                <h2>So Say We All</h2>
                <p>Battlestar Galactica proved that science fiction could be prestige television. In 2004, the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) reinvented a cheesy 1970s space opera into a post-9/11 meditation on terrorism, occupation, faith, and what it means to be human. The result is one of the most ambitious shows in television history.</p>
                
                <h3>What Makes It Great</h3>
                <p>The show's genius is treating its premise deadly seriously. When the Cylons destroy the Twelve Colonies, killing billions, it's not backstory—it's the emotional engine that drives every character. The survivors aren't heroes; they're traumatized refugees making impossible choices. Admiral Adama and President Roslin lead a fleet where every decision costs lives.</p>
                
                <h3>Character-Driven Science Fiction</h3>
                <p>Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell anchor the show with performances that never wink at the genre. Their counterparts—the Cylons—get something rare: compelling villains with comprehensible motivations. Number Six, Sharon, Brother Cavil—they're not evil robots, they're the descendants of humanity's own sins.</p>
                
                <h3>The Politics of Survival</h3>
                <p>BSG uses its premise to explore questions that post-9/11 America wasn't ready to ask directly: When is torture justified? How do democracies survive under existential threat? What do we owe to refugees, to prisoners, to enemies who might be us? The show doesn't lecture—it dramatizes, forcing viewers to sit with uncomfortable parallels.</p>
                
                <h3>The Ending Problem</h3>
                <p>The finale is controversial, and the score reflects that. After building intricate mysteries—"Who is the final Cylon?"—the resolutions feel more convenient than earned. The religious elements shift from ambiguous to explicit. But even a flawed conclusion can't diminish four seasons of groundbreaking television.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Bold, political, character-driven science fiction. The journey matters more than the destination.</p>
