                <h2>Hitman With a Heart of Gold? Not Quite.</h2>
                <p>Barry is a show about a man who wants to be good but is very, very bad at it. The premise—a hitman discovers acting and tries to leave his old life behind—sounds like a dark comedy_setup. What Bill Hader and Alec Berg deliver is something more disturbing: a character study of a man who might be beyond redemption, no matter how hard he tries.</p>
                
                <h3>Comedy That Isn't Funny</h3>
                <p>The show keeps shifting tones like a transmission grinding gears. One minute, Henry Winkler's Gene Cousineau is the funniest acting teacher on television. The next, Barry is killing someone with a baseball bat in a scene shot like a horror film. The comedy doesn't soften the violence—it makes it worse by showing how close darkness always is to the mundane.</p>
                
                <h3>Performance as Transformation</h3>
                <p>Hader's performance is extraordinary. His Barry can be terrifying, pathetic, hilarious, and heartbreaking—sometimes in the same scene. The acting class scenes aren't just parody; they're about whether someone whose entire profession requires suppressing emotion can learn to access real feelings. Sarah Goldberg's Sally is equally compelling, a narcissist whose ambition keeps colliding with her self-awareness.</p>
                
                <h3>The Season 3 Problem</h3>
                <p>The score reflects seasons 1-3 specifically. By the third season, Barry's attempts to escape his past have created so much carnage that the central question shifts from "Can Barry change?" to "Should Barry change?" The body count rises, the guilt compounds, and the comedy grows thinner. Season 4 resolves these threads, but at the cost of what made the show special.</p>
                
                <h3>Why We Keep Watching</h3>
                <p>Anthony Carrigan's NoHo Hank is the show's secret weapon—a Chechen gangster so winningly optimistic that he becomes the moral center of a show with no morals. His scenes with Barry are a masterclass in mismatched buddy dynamics.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> A tragicomedy that stops being funny and becomes something darker. Hader is a revelation.</p>
