                <h2>Ass-Kicking as Art Form</h2>
                <p>Banshee is pure id—a show about a career criminal who steals a sheriff's identity and proceeds to bring his particular brand of violence to an Amish-adjacent Pennsylvania town. Plot logic is secondary to momentum; character depth is secondary to punching. And somehow, it works.</p>
                
                <h3>Lucas Hood</h3>
                <p>Antony Starr plays the fake sheriff with a charisma that makes immaturity watchable. He's a terrible sheriff but an effective fighter, and the show's thesis is that sometimes terrible is what you need. The central con—he's impersonating a dead man—should collapse immediately, but Banshee commits so fully to its own absurdity that you stop questioning.</p>
                
                <h3>Action Television</h3>
                <p>The fight scenes are among television's most visceral. Not elegant choreography—brutal, ugly, exhausting brawls where everyone ends up bloody. The show's secret weapon is its willingness to let consequences accumulate. People get hurt and stay hurt.</p>
                
                <h3>The Amish Mafia</h3>
                <p>Ulrich Thomsen plays Kai Proctor, a former Amish man turned crime lord, with quiet menace. His relationship with his estranged family—and with Hood—is the show's moral center, such as it is. Banshee isn't interested in good and evil; it's interested in force and consequence.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Not Higher?</h3>
                <p>The conceptual density score reflects a show that isn't trying to say anything profound. Banshee is an action procedural with higher production values and better writing than the genre typically receives. It's extremely good at what it does—but what it does has limits.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Lean, mean, and absolutely committed. The best pure action show on television.</p>
