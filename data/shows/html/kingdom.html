                <h2>MMA Family Drama</h2>
                <p>Kingdom is about family first, fighting second. Frank Grillo runs an MMA gym in Venice Beach, training fighters while his own family falls apart. It's the best show you've never heard of—buried on AT&T's Audience Network, cancelled before streaming made it accessible.</p>
                
                <h3>The Family</h3>
                <p>Grillo's Alvey Kulina is a former fighter past his prime, running a gym and raising two sons who also fight. Jonathan Tucker and Nick Jonas play Jay and Nate—each damaged, each fighting for different reasons. The mother (Joanna Going) is an addict who loves her children but can't stop destroying herself. This isn't Rocky; it's family tragedy in a gym.</p>
                
                <h3>The Fighting</h3>
                <p>The MMA scenes are brutal and authentic. The actors trained extensively, and it shows. But the fights aren't about spectacle—they're character moments. Every cage match reveals something about who these people are and what they're running from.</p>
                
                <h3>Addiction as Theme</h3>
                <p>Kingdom treats addiction with unusual depth. Not just substance addiction—fighting addiction, rage addiction, the need to feel something through pain. Tucker's Jay Kulina is a masterpiece of manic energy and self-destruction, using cocaine and violence to manage emotions he can't face.</p>
                
                <h3>The Resolution</h3>
                <p>The show got three seasons and a proper ending. Not every thread is tied, but the major character arcs reach satisfying conclusions. The final image is hopeful without being neat—a family broken but still standing.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best show nobody watched. MMA as family therapy.</p>
