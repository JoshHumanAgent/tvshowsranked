                <h2>The Great AmericanNovel on Television</h2>
                <p>The Wire is frequently called the greatest television series ever made—not for its entertainment value, but for its literary ambition. Creator David Simon didn't make a cop show; he made a systemic critique of American institutions, using Baltimore as his laboratory and the drug trade as his lens.</p>
                
                <h3>Institutional Critique</h3>
                <p>Each of the five seasons examines a different institution: the drug trade, the port, city politics, the school system, and the media. The thesis is devastating—these systems don't fail by accident; they fail because they're designed to fail, because they serve the people who run them rather than the people they're meant to serve. No show before or since has attempted anything this ambitious.</p>
                
                <h3>The Moral Complexity</h3>
                <p>There are no good guys and bad guys in The Wire—there are only people caught in systems larger than themselves. Omar Little, the robber who targets drug dealers, became one of television's most complex characters—a gay man in a hyper-masculine world who lives by a strict moral code. String Belllass the drug kingpin who wants to go legit. McNulty, the detective whose brilliance is matched only by his self-destruction. Every character is fully realized.</p>
                
                <h3>The Density</h3>
                <p>The Wire demands attention. It refuses to hold the viewer's hand. Episodes go by without gunfights; seasons build to payoffs that only make sense if you've been paying attention to every scene. This is television that respects its audience's intelligence—or punishes their inattention.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Not #1?</h3>
                <p>The Wire scores low on visual spectacle because spectacle isn't the point. It scores lower on narrative drive because the show is deliberately paced—meandering in ways that serve its thematic goals but test viewer patience. For pure entertainment, other shows rank higher. For artistic achievement, The Wire may have no equal.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The smartest show ever made. Required viewing for anyone who wants to understand American cities.</p>
