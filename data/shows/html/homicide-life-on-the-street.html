                <h2>The Blueprint</h2>
                <p>Before The Wire, before The Sopranos, there was Homicide. Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana's Baltimore police drama invented the grammar of prestige television. Based on David Simon's book, it proved that network TV could do what HBO would later claim as its own invention.</p>
                
                <h3>Andre Braugher</h3>
                <p>Frank Pembleton is television's greatest detective. Braugher's performance—mercurial, brilliant, morally complicated—set the standard for every prestige anti-hero that followed. His interrogation scenes remain unmatched in TV history. The character acting score reflects not just Braugher but an ensemble that treated every detective as a complete human being.</p>
                
                <h3>The Box</h3>
                <p>Homicide's interrogation room—"The Box"—is a character itself. Episodes that take place almost entirely in this room demonstrate that television doesn't need locations, just characters in conflict. The writers understood that two people talking can be more dramatic than any car chase.</p>
                
                <h3>Documentary Style</h3>
                <p>The handheld camera, the overlapping dialogue, the refusal to pretty up Baltimore—Homicide brought documentary aesthetics to scripted drama. It looked like nothing else on television in 1993, and it still looks fresher than most shows today.</p>
                
                <h3>The Legacy</h3>
                <p>Homicide ran seven seasons, saw major cast turnover, and never got the finale it deserved. But it proved that television could be literature. The resolution score reflects an imperfect ending; every other score reflects a perfect beginning.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The show that taught television to take itself seriously. Essential viewing.</p>
