                <h2>Escape from Williamsburg</h2>
                <p>Unorthodox is four episodes of liberation—an escape thriller about a young woman fleeing her ultra-Orthodox Jewish community for a life she can barely imagine. Shira Haas's performance is a masterclass in constraint and release; she plays a character discovering autonomy in real time.</p>
                
                <h3>Two Worlds</h3>
                <p>The series cuts between Esty's new life in Berlin—music school, new friends, experiences she never knew existed—and flashbacks to her arranged marriage in Williamsburg. The contrast is never heavy-handed. We understand why she left, but also what she's leaving behind. The Satmar community isn't demonized; it's shown as a world with rules that simply became unbearable for one person.</p>
                
                <h3>The Marriage Bed</h3>
                <p>The flashbacks to Esty's marriage are the show's most difficult scenes. The strictures around intimacy, the lack of privacy, the performance of wifely duty—these aren't presented as atrocities but as systemic constraints that slowly suffocate. The horror isn't in cruelty; it's in normalcy.</p>
                
                <h3>Berlin as Freedom</h3>
                <p>Berlin represents possibility, but also loneliness. Esty's new friends are kind, but they don't understand what she's escaped. The music academy audition scene—the culmination of her journey—is thrilling because she's claiming something that was always hers.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Four Episodes?</h3>
                <p>Based on a memoir, Unorthodox knows exactly how much story it has. There's no padding, no subplots to fill hours. Four episodes, one journey, zero waste. This is miniseries craft at its most economical.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> A tiny series with enormous impact. Shira Haas is unforgettable.</p>
