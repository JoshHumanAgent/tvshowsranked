                <h2>Belgian Noir Done Right</h2>
                <p>Tabula Rasa is a Belgian psychological thriller about a young woman with amnesia who becomes the only witness to a disappearance. It's a small-scale mystery with outsize tension, proving that language barriers shouldn't exist for quality television.</p>
                
                <h3>Mie, Missing</h3>
                <p>Veerle Baetens plays Mie, a woman in a psychiatric hospital who can't remember the last 24 hours—hours during which someone vanished. As she tries to reconstruct her memory, she realizes that what she can't remember might be more dangerous than what she can.</p>
                
                <h3>The Unreliable Narrator</h3>
                <p>The amnesia premise could be a gimmick, but Tabula Rasa uses it structurally. Mie's gaps are the audience's gaps. As she recovers fragments, we recover them with her—and some fragments contradict others. The question isn't just what happened, but whether Mie's perception can be trusted at all.</p>
                
                <h3>Flemish Noir</h3>
                <p>The show's visual palette is muted greys and blues, the psychiatric setting both claustrophobic and somehow threatening. Belgium's particular brand of mundane creepiness—neither Scandinavian noir nor Mediterranean heat—gives the series a distinctive atmosphere.</p>
                
                <h3>Complete in One Season</h3>
                <p>Unlike many mysteries that stretch indefinitely, Tabula Rasa tells one complete story in nine episodes. It doesn't set up seasons that will never come. The resolution is satisfying, if not exactly happy.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Tight psychological thriller. Belgian television at its accessible best.</p>
