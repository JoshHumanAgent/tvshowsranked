                <h2>The Cost of Lies</h2>
                <p>Chernobyl is five hours of escalating dread—a miniseries about the 1986 nuclear disaster that plays like a horror film where the monster is invisible, unstoppable, and created by human hubris. Craig Mazin's masterpiece is the highest-rated television series in IMDb history, and for good reason.</p>
                
                <h3>The Horror of Truth</h3>
                <p>What makes Chernobyl terrifying isn't the radiation—it's the lies. The Soviet system's inability to admit fault, the bureaucratic cowardice that made the disaster worse, the ideological blindness that cost thousands of lives. Jared Harris's Valery Legasov is the voice of scientific reason in a system thatpunishes truth, and his fate is the show's moral center.</p>
                
                <h3>The Sacrifice</h3>
                <p>The miniseries honors the liquidators—the firefighters, miners, soldiers, and scientists who knowingly exposed themselves to fatal radiation to prevent an even greater catastrophe. The scene where three divers volunteer to drain radioactive water beneath the reactor is one of television's most powerful depictions of heroism.</p>
                
                <h3>The Aesthetic of Dread</h3>
                <p>Director Johan Renck creates an atmosphere of mounting terror. The Geiger counter clicks, the radiation burns, the slow-motion contamination of everyone and everything—it'sviscerally effective without being exploitative. The production design immerses you in 1980s Soviet Ukraine so completely you can almost taste the ash.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Not Higher?</h3>
                <p>Chernobyl scores slightly lower on resolution because it's a single story with a predetermined ending. There's no narrative innovation in how it concludes—the reactor explodes, the truth comes out, Legasov testifies. But the execution is so perfect that it hardly matters. This is television as historical reckoning.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> A perfect miniseries. Five hours of sustained terror and moral weight.</p>
