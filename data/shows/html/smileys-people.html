                <h2>The Perfect Ending</h2>
                <p>Smiley's People completes what Tinker Tailor began. If Tinker Tailor is about finding the mole, Smiley's People is about what happens after—the moral compromises, the old debts, the final reckoning. Alec Guinness returns as George Smiley, older and wearier, pulled back for one last operation.</p>
                
                <h3>Guinness Again</h3>
                <p>The character acting score remains maximum. Guinness deepens Smiley—more vulnerable, more haunted. He's not just solving a case; he's confronting everything he sacrificed for the Circus. The famous final scene, Smiley walking away, is television's equivalent of The Godfather's closing door.</p>
                
                <h3>Karla</h3>
                <p>After two miniseries, we finally see Karla—Smiley's Soviet counterpart—as more than a shadow. The resolution isn't violent confrontation; it's understanding. Smiley defeats Karla not by force but by knowing him completely. The conceptual density score reflects mature, philosophical espionage.</p>
                
                <h3>The Hamburg Connection</h3>
                <p>The narrative drive score reflects tighter pacing than Tinker Tailor. There's genuine urgency—people die, networks collapse, time runs out. Smiley moves through a Europe of aging spies and forgotten arrangements, a twilight world beautifully captured.</p>
                
                <h3>Complete</h3>
                <p>The resolution score recognizes that Smiley's People provides closure. This isn't a cliffhanger or a setup for sequels. It's an ending—one of television's most satisfying endings. Smiley walks out of the Circus, out of the Cold War, out of the life he gave everything for.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Tinker Tailor is the puzzle. Smiley's People is the answer. Together, perfect.</p>
