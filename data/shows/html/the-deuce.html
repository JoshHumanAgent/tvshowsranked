                <h2>The Birth of Porn, the Death of Times Square</h2>
                <p>David Simon's follow-up to The Wire is a period piece about the legalization of pornography and the transformation of Times Square from urban decay to corporate sanitization. It's about sex work, sure, but mostly about how capitalism absorbs and neutralizes counterculture.</p>
                
                <h3>Two James Francos</h3>
                <p>Franco plays twin brothers—Vincent, a bar owner with a gambling problem, and Frankie, a degenerate gambler with the mob. The performance(s) are impressive technically, but the real draw is watching Simon's Baltimore sensibility applied to 1970s New York.</p>
                
                <h3>Maggie Gyllenhaal's Eileen</h3>
                <p>Gyllenhaal plays a sex worker turned porn pioneer with agency that's rarely afforded to such characters. She's not a victim or a symbol—she's a businesswoman navigating a world designed to exploit her. Her scenes directing porn are among the show's most nuanced.</p>
                
                <h3>The System, Not the People</h3>
                <p>Like The Wire, The Deuce is interested in systems. The mob, the police, the city government, the porn industry—Simon shows how these institutions interact, how people get ground up in their gears, how "progress" often means pushing problems somewhere else rather than solving them.</p>
                
                <h3>Pacing and Patience</h3>
                <p>The narrative drive score reflects a deliberate pace. Simon isn't interested in plot twists; he's interested in showing how a world changes over time. Some viewers found it slow. Others found it revelatory. It rewards patience.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Simon does Times Square. Social history as television drama.</p>
