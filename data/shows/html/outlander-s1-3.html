                <h2>Time Travel as Romance</h2>
                <p>Outlander is what happens when romance novels get a prestige TV budget. Claire Randall, a World War II nurse, touches ancient standing stones in Scotland and wakes up two centuries earlier—a woman out of time in a brutal era. The show's first three seasons are a sustained achievement in period detail, emotional stakes, and the chemistry between its leads.</p>
                
                <h3>Claire and Jamie</h3>
                <p>Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan's chemistry is the show's foundation. Claire is one of television's most capable heroines—modern, stubborn, medical knowledge that saves lives in 1743. Jamie Fraser is the romantic ideal: honorable, devoted, vulnerable. Their relationship isn't without conflict, but it's built on mutual respect that feels earned.</p>
                
                <h3>The Brutality of History</h3>
                <p>Outlander doesn't romanticize the past. It shows the violence visited upon women, the brutality of English oppression, the rawness of eighteenth-century life. Sexual violence is present and unflinching—not gratuitous, but not softened either. The show earns its mature rating by treating trauma seriously.</p>
                
                <h3>Season 1: Scotland</h3>
                <p>The first season is the strongest—Claire's displacement, Jamie's world, the Jacobite rising building toward Culloden. The show's scope is intimate yet epic, personal yet historical. When Claire must choose between her 20th-century husband and her 18th-century love, the choice carries real weight.</p>
                
                <h3>Why S1-3 Only?</h3>
                <p>The score reflects seasons 1-3 specifically. Later seasons, adapting Diana Gabaldon's increasingly sprawling novels, lose focus. The show is best when centered on Claire and Jamie together; when they're separated or the narrative fragments across continents and decades, it loses its engine.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Romance with historical heft. The chemistry alone justifies the journey.</p>
