                <h2>The Greatest Television You've Never Seen</h2>
                <p>I, Claudius is a 1976 BBC miniseries about the Roman Empire, told through the eyes of Claudius—a stuttering, limping scholar who accidentally becomes emperor. It has no battle scenes, no special effects, almost no outdoor footage. It's twelve episodes of people talking in rooms. And it's better than almost anything made since.</p>
                
                <h3>The Cast</h3>
                <p>Brian Blessed as Augustus. Derek Jacobi as Claudius. John Hurt as Caligula. Sian Phillips as Livia. These performances are legendary. Jacobi plays Claudius as a man hiding his intelligence behind disability—one of television's great unreliable narrators. Hurt's Caligula is terrifying not because he's violent, but because he's unhinged in ways that feel historically plausible.</p>
                
                <h3>The World</h3>
                <p>The score for world building reflects how thoroughly the Julio-Claudian dynasty is realized. Livia poisons her way through the family tree; Tiberius descends into paranoia; Caligula goes mad; Claudius watches it all, waiting his turn. Roman politics hasn't been this compelling since—well, since Rome itself.</p>
                
                <h3>The Production</h3>
                <p>The cinematography score is low because 1976 BBC production values were minimal. But the acting scores are off the charts. When you have performers this good, you don't need spectacle. The script (by Jack Pulman, from Robert Graves's novels) gives them words worth speaking, and they speak them brilliantly.</p>
                
                <h3>The Legacy</h3>
                <p>I, Claudius influenced every political drama that followed. House of Cards owes it a debt. The Sopranos owes it a debt. Any show about power, family, and betrayal owes it a debt. The conceptual density score reflects a show that understands power the way Shakespeare understood it—as a poison that corrupts everyone who touches it.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Twelve episodes of perfect television. Production values don't matter when the writing and acting are this good.</p>
