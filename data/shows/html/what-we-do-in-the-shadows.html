                <h2>Roommates from Hell (Literally)</h2>
                <p>What We Do in the Shadows takes the mockumentary format and applies it to vampires sharing a Staten Island house. Taika Waititi's film becomes a series that shouldn't work but absolutely does—sustaining its premise through character work so specific it makes immortality feel mundane.</p>
                
                <h3>The Four Vampires</h3>
                <p>Nandor the Relentless is a former Ottoman warrior whose confidence far exceeds his competence. Laszlo and Nadja are a married couple whose eternal romance is built on mutual depravity. Colin Robinson is an energy vampire who drains victims through tedious conversation. Each has a distinct comedic rhythm; together, they're the best dysfunctional household on television.</p>
                
                <h3>Comedy of the Mundane</h3>
                <p>The show's genius is making supernatural life feel ordinary. Vampires argue about chores. They struggle with technology. They have feuds with werewolves that play like suburban neighbor disputes. The mockumentary format—deadpan interviews, awkward pauses, caught-on-camera moments—grounds absurdity in reality.</p>
                
                <h3>Mythic Continuity</h3>
                <p>Despite being a comedy, the show maintains rigorous continuity with vampire lore. Stakes work. Sunlight kills. Invitations are required to enter homes. Each constraint becomes a punchline—the invitation rule leads to elaborate schemes to get invited into nightclubs.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Not Higher?</h3>
                <p>The ranking reflects what the show is: consistent comedy without pretension to more. It's not trying to break your heart or make you think about mortality. It's trying to make you laugh at energy vampires and bat transformations gone wrong. At that, it succeeds brilliantly—but that's not the same as greatness.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best comedy about immortal roommates ever made. A perfect show for what it is.</p>
