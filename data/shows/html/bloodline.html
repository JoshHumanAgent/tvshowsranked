                <h2>Florida Keys Noir</h2>
                <p>Bloodline is what happens when a family drama becomes a thriller becomes a tragedy. The Rayburns run a hotel in the Florida Keys; when black-sheep brother Danny returns, decades of secrets surface. Kyle Chandler anchors the cast as John, the "good" brother whose morality erodes episode by episode.</p>
                
                <h3>The Rayburn Family</h3>
                <p>Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard play the parents with lived-in weight. The adult children—Kyle Chandler, Linda Cardellini, Norbert Leo Butz, and Ben Mendelsohn as Danny—each carry their own damage. Bloodline understands that family dysfunction isn't about one villain; it's about systems that protect some and destroy others.</p>
                
                <h3>Danny Rayburn</h3>
                <p>Ben Mendelsohn's performance is the show's engine. Danny is the family scapegoat, the one everyone blames for a childhood tragedy. He's also manipulative, self-destructive, and dangerous. The show never lets you decide if he's victim or villain—he's both.</p>
                
                <h3>Location as Character</h3>
                <p>The Florida Keys setting is perfect: beautiful, humid, rotting beneath the sun. The water is everywhere, and secrets flow as easily as the tides. The cinematography captures how paradise can feel like a trap.</p>
                
                <h3>The Decline</h3>
                <p>Season one is perfect television—propulsive, morally complex, devastating. Seasons two and three, made after Mendelsohn's character arc concluded, struggle to maintain momentum without their antagonist. The resolution score reflects a show that peaked early.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Season one is essential viewing. The rest completes the story, if not the promise.</p>
