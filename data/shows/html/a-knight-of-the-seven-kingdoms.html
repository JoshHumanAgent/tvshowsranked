                <h2>The Dunk and Egg Saga Begins</h2>
                <p>A century before Daenerys Targaryen, before Robert's Rebellion, before the events that would tear Westeros apart—a hedge knight and his squire rode through a realm still remembering dragons. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms adapts George R.R. Martin's beloved novellas about Ser Duncan the Tall and the young Egg, and it captures something the main Game of Thrones series lost in its later seasons: the sense of a fully lived-in world where small stories matter.</p>
                
                <h3>A Smaller, More Intimate Westeros</h3>
                <p>Where Game of Thrones aimed for epic scope—wars, dragons, the fate of the realm—this series finds its power in the margins. Dunk is no great lord, just a knight trying to live by his code in a world that rarely rewards honor. Egg is a prince in disguise, learning that crowns don't make men wise. Their bond forms the heart of a story that understands Westeros is most interesting when we're not watching thrones being contested.</p>
                
                <h3>The Targaryen Era at Its Peak</h3>
                <p>The production designs captures the golden age of Targaryen rule—castles that haven't yet fallen into ruin, tournaments that haven't yet become massacres, a dynasty at the height of its power and the beginning of its rot. We see the Seven Kingdoms through fresh eyes, before we knew how badly everything would end. There's something melancholy in that—the audience knows what's coming, even as these characters ride toward a future they can't imagine.</p>
                
                <h3>The Martin Difference</h3>
                <p>These stories come from source material Martin actually finished, and it shows. The plotting is tight, the character beats earned, the world-building consistent. This is the Westeros fans fell in love with—not the rushed approximation of the final seasons, but a place where each tournament, each feast, each roadside encounter carries weight and wonder.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Not Higher?</h3>
                <p>The resolution score reflects the show's ongoing status—at six episodes, we're seeing only the beginning of Dunk and Egg's journey. As the story develops and completes its arcs, this score will likely rise. For now, it sits just outside the top three on the strength of its world alone.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The Westeros that was. A smaller story with a big heart.</p>
