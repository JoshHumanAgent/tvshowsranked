                <h2>The Show That Changed Television</h2>
                <p>Before The Sopranos, television was episodic—stories wrapped up neatly each week. David Chase's mafia family drama didn't just break that rule; it shattered it, creating the template for every prestige drama that followed. Tony Soprano wasn't an anti-hero; he was a sociopath you couldn't stop watching.</p>
                
                <h3>Tony Soprano</h3>
                <p>James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano is one of the great performances in any medium. A mob boss who goes to therapy, who loves his family while cheating on his wife, who kills without remorse but panics about ducks in his pool. The contradiction is the point—this is a man who compartmentalizes so effectively that he might believe his ownlies.</p>
                
                <h3>The Therapy Sessions</h3>
                <p>The genius move was putting a mob boss in therapy. These scenes—Tony talking to Dr. Melfi—became the show's structural spine, allowing for introspection and character depth that pure crime drama couldn't achieve. Jennifer Melfi is the audience surrogate, watching Tony with a mixture of clinical detachment and growing horror.</p>
                
                <h3>The Ending</h3>
                <p>That ending. "Don't Stop Believin'" cuts to black, and the internet exploded. Years later, it's clear: the cut to black is the point. Life doesn't have neat conclusions. Tony will either die or he won't. The point is that we'll never know—just as none of us knows how our story ends.</p>
                
                <h3>The Resolution Score</h3>
                <p>The Sopranos loses points on resolution not because the ending was bad—it was perfect—but because it was divisive. Many viewers wanted closure; Chase refused to give it. For some, this was brilliance; for others, it was a cop-out. The score reflects that ambivalence.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The show that invented modern television. Every prestige drama is in its debt.</p>
