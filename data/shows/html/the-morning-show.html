                <h2>#MeToo Morning Television</h2>
                <p>The Morning Show launched Apple TV+ with star power—Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell—in a drama about morning television rocked by a sexual misconduct scandal. It's slick, well-acted, and occasionally profound about power dynamics in media.</p>
                
                <h3>Alex and Bradley</h3>
                <p>Aniston's Alex Levy is the anchor whose perfect facade cracks when her co-host (Carell) is fired for misconduct. Witherspoon's Bradley Jackson is the regional reporter who becomes her unlikely partner. Their relationship—from antagonism to alliance to something more complicated—drives the show.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mitch Problem</h3>
                <p>Steve Carell plays Mitch Kessler, the disgraced anchor, with uncomfortable nuance. The show refuses to make him a monster, instead exploring how he rationalized his behavior and how the network enabled him. It's brave television that doesn't always work—but it tries.</p>
                
                <h3>The Media Satire</h3>
                <p>The behind-the-scenes machinations of morning TV are rendered in loving detail. Billy Crudup as Cory Ellison, the network executive, walks away with every scene he's in. The show understands that morning television is a strange beast—news, entertainment, and therapy all mixed together.</p>
                
                <h3>Why It Ranks Here</h3>
                <p>The Morning Show is extremely well-made corporate prestige television. But it never quite transcends its genre. The stakes feel manufactured, the speeches a bit too speechy, the revelations a bit too convenient. It's very good at what it does—but what it does has a ceiling.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Slick, star-studded, occasionally insightful. The best show about morning TV, but that's a narrow category.</p>
