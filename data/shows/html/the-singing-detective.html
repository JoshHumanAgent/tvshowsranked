                <h2>The Best Thing Television Has Ever Done</h2>
                <p>Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective is six episodes of pure genius. Michael Gambon plays a psoriatic arthritic writer hospitalized with a skin condition so severe he can barely move. He rewrites his detective novel in his head, hallucinates musical numbers, and relives his childhood trauma. It sounds insane. It is insane. It's also perfect.</p>
                
                <h3>Michael Gambon</h3>
                <p>Before Dumbledore, Gambon was Philip Marlow—not the detective, the writer. (The detective character is also named Philip Marlow because nothing in this show is simple.) Gambon performs mostly from a hospital bed, in pain, unable to move, and still delivers one of the greatest acting performances in television history. The character score reflects a masterclass in physical and emotional acting.</p>
                
                <h3>Meta-Narrative Upon Meta-Narrative</h3>
                <p>There are three layers: the hospital, the detective novel Marlow is rewriting, and the childhood memories he can't escape. Characters appear in multiple layers. Actors play multiple roles. The conceptual density score reflects a show that demands—and rewards—complete attention. This is television as literature.</p>
                
                <h3>The Musical Numbers</h3>
                <p>Patients and nurses suddenly lip-sync to 1940s pop songs. It's not explained; it simply happens, emerging from Marlow's fevered imagination. These aren't interruptions—they're psychological expressions. Potter understood that music carries memory and emotion in ways dialogue can't.</p>
                
                <h3>Art as Therapy</h3>
                <p>The Singing Detective is about writing as survival. Marlow rewrites his past, his present, his trauma into fiction. By the final episode, the act of creation has healed him—or at least made healing possible. The resolution score reflects one of television's most satisfying conclusions.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The greatest miniseries ever made. Nothing else is close.</p>
