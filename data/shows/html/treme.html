                <h2>Post-Katrina New Orleans</h2>
                <p>Tremé is David Simon's love letter to New Orleans—a show about a city rebuilding itself through music, food, and stubborn refusal to disappear. It's not The Wire; it's something gentler and more humane. The crime exists, but so do the second lines, the brass bands, and the gumbo.</p>
                
                <h3>Music as Narrative</h3>
                <p>The show centers on musicians—real New Orleans artists playing themselves alongside actors. Wendell Pierce as Antoine Batiste, a trombonist always one gig away from stability. Clarke Peters as Albert "Big Chief" Lambreaux, Mardi Gras Indian chief rebuilding his tribe. The music isn't soundtrack; it's plot, character, and meaning.</p>
                
                <h3>The World Building Score</h3>
                <p>Nine out of ten. No show has ever captured a city this completely—the food, the music, the politics, the corruption, the resilience. Simon and co-creator Eric Overmyer treat New Orleans as a character deserving respect, not a backdrop for outsider stories.</p>
                
                <h3>Slow Television</h3>
                <p>The narrative drive score reflects Tremé's intentional pacing. This isn't binge television; it's Sunday night television, best absorbed slowly. Stories unfold over seasons, not episodes. If you need constant momentum, this isn't your show. If you want immersion, it's essential.</p>
                
                <h3>The Complete Story</h3>
                <p>Four seasons, thirty-six episodes, a full arc. HBO let Simon finish on his terms, and the final season provides real closure. The resolution score reflects a show that knew when to end.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Television as cultural preservation. David Simon's most human work.</p>
