                <h2>High School Is Hell (Literally)</h2>
                <p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer invented the modern genre show. Before Buffy, horror on television was episodic and forgettable. After Buffy, shows could build season-long arcs, kill major characters, and treat monsters as metaphors for real issues. Joss Whedon's creation is foundational—even if parts haven't aged well.</p>
                
                <h3>Monster as Metaphor</h3>
                <p>The show's genius is literalizing adolescence. The cheerleader who literally loses her head. The boyfriend who becomes a monster after sex. The invisible girl who nobody noticed. Buffy made the pains of growing up into actual demons, and the result was television that took teenage feelings seriously.</p>
                
                <h3>The Scooby Gang</h3>
                <p>Buffy isn't a solo hero—she's surrounded by one of television's great ensembles. Willow's transformation from shy nerd to powerful witch. Xander as the heart of the group despite having no powers. Giles as the father figure who becomes family. The relationships are the show's engine; the monsters are just complications.</p>
                
                <h3>Seasonal Peaks and Valleys</h3>
                <p>Seasons 2, 3, and 5 are peak Buffy—emotional, inventive, consequence-heavy. Season 4's Initiative arc is a misstep. Season 6's descent into darkness divided fans. Season 7's First Evil never quite landed. The show's inconsistency is why it ranks here rather than higher—but its peaks are as high as television gets.</p>
                
                <h3>The Whedon Problem</h3>
                <p>The show's legacy is complicated by revelations about Whedon's behavior on set. Charisma Carpenter and other actors have described toxic environments. This doesn't erase what the show achieved, but it colors how we view its creation. The art and the artist are entangled.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Foundational television. Imperfect, influential, essential for understanding what came after.</p>
