                <h2>Prohibition's Perfect Stage</h2>
                <p>Boardwalk Empire is television's most beautiful period piece—a lovingly rendered vision of Atlantic City during Prohibition, when gangsters became celebrities and the American experiment in outlawing alcohol created a criminal economy that still exists today.</p>
                
                <h3>The Production</h3>
                <p>Martin Scorsese directed the pilot, and his influence permeates every frame. The production values are staggering—a 300-foot boardwalk built from scratch, period-accurate costumes by the hundred, a level of detail that makes 1920Atlantic City feel like a time machine. This is what HBO money looked like at its peak.</p>
                
                <h3>Nucky Thompson</h3>
                <p>Steve Buscemi's Enoch "Nucky" Thompson is a creature unlike any other on television—the treasurer of Atlantic City who runs the city like a fiefdom, equal parts politician and gangster. Buscemi brings an unlikely gravitas to a man whose power comes from favors and threats.</p>
                
                <h3>The Ensemble</h3>
                <p>Michael Pitt's Jimmy Darmody is the show's tragic heart—a young man damaged by war who wants to be a gangster and discovers that the costs are higher than he imagined. Michael Shannon's Prohibition agent Nelson Van Alden is one of television's most fascinating religious hypocrites. And the supporting rogues' gallery includes fictional and historical figures—Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Arnold Rothstein—woven together seamlessly.</p>
                
                <h3>Why It Ranks Here</h3>
                <p>Boardwalk Empire scores highest on world building and visual spectacle—few shows have ever looked this good. It loses points on narrative drive (the deliberate pacing can drag) and resolution (the final season was rushed after HBO ended it early). But for pure atmosphere and historical immersion, nothing beats it.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong>The most gorgeous period drama ever made. Prohibition never looked so good—or so deadly.</p>
