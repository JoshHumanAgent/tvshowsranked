                <h2>Alec Guinness as George Smiley</h2>
                <p>John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is the anti-Bond. No gadgets, no explosions, no glamour—just middle-aged men in gray suits, moving pieces on a chessboard they can barely see. Alec Guinness's George Smiley is the greatest spy ever committed to screen, not because of what he does, but because of what he notices.</p>
                
                <h3>Smiley</h3>
                <p>Guinness plays Smiley as a man easy to underestimate—boring, invisible, forgettable. This is his weapon. He waits. He watches. He remembers. When he finally moves, it's devastating. The character acting score reflects one of television's greatest performances.</p>
                
                <h3>The Circus</h3>
                <p>Le Carré called the British Secret Service "the Circus," and this adaptation captures its bureaucracy perfectly. Spies aren't heroes; they're bureaucrats with secrets. They betray each other for promotions. They destroy lives to protect their pensions. The world building score reflects the most realistic espionage ever depicted.</p>
                
                <h3>The Pace</h3>
                <p>Seven episodes. Slow by modern standards. Perfect for this story. The narrative drive score reflects a deliberate pace that rewards attention—every pause matters, every glance means something. If you need constant action, watch something else. If you want to feel intelligent, watch this.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mole</h3>
                <p>Smiley must find a Soviet mole at the top of British intelligence. We know it's one of four men. We watch Smiley work backward through years of operations, finding the contradictions that betray the traitor. The resolution score reflects a perfect ending—satisfying, inevitable, quietly devastating.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best espionage television ever made. Alec Guinness defines the genre.</p>
