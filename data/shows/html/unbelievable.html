                <h2>Believing Women</h2>
                <p>Unbelievable is eight episodes of controlled fury—a true crime story that's less about catching a serial rapist and more about a system designed not to believe victims. Based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning article, it follows Marie, a teenager accused of lying about her assault, and the two detectives who eventually connected his pattern years later.</p>
                
                <h3>The Weight of Not Being Believed</h3>
                <p>The miniseries opens with Marie's interrogation, and it's almost unbearable to watch. Detectives treat her as a suspect from the moment she reports being raped at knifepoint. The psychological manipulation—suggesting she made it up for attention, wearing her down until she recants—is shown in unflinching detail. Kaitlyn Dever's performance captures the devastating confusion of someone whose trauma is being denied by authorities.</p>
                
                <h3>Two Detectives, One Goal</h3>
                <p>The parallel narrative follows detectives Grace Rasmussen (Toni Collette) and Karen Duvall (Merritt Wever) investigating similar rapes in Colorado. Their partnership is the show's antidote to the earlier interrogation—they believe victims, they share information, they do the work. Collette and Wever are both exceptional, turning procedure into something approaching redemption.</p>
                
                <h3>Systemic Failure Made Personal</h3>
                <p>What makes Unbelievable essential viewing is its focus on institutional failure rather than individual villainy. The detectives who coerced Marie aren't evil—they're following training that assumes false reports are common, that traumatized victims should present evidence a certain way. The series shows how good intentions and bad systems produce the same result as malice.</p>
                
                <h3>One Perfect Scene</h3>
                <p>The moment when the detectives finally see Marie's photo—when the pattern clicks and they realize what their colleagues did to her—is television at its most cathartic. No speeches, just the weight of recognition.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Essential viewing. A true crime story that indicts the system without exploiting the victim.</p>
