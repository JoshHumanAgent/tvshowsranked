                <h2>The System Devours</h2>
                <p>The Night Of is eight episodes of systemic failure. A Pakistani-American college student borrows his father's cab to go to a party, wakes up with a dead woman he just met, and finds himself swallowed by a justice system designed for people exactly like him.</p>
                
                <h3>Nasir Khan</h3>
                <p>Riz Ahmed's performance is a slow-motion collapse. When we meet Nasir, he's a naive kid. By the end, after months on Rikers Island, he's someone else entirely—with a neck tattoo, a heroin habit, and survival instincts that terrify his family. The show's thesis is that prison doesn't just punish; it transforms.</p>
                
                <h3>John Stone</h3>
                <p>John Turturro's lawyer is the unlikely hero—an eczema-suffering attorney who takes cases nobody wants and discovers a capacity for actual advocacy. His obsession with Nasir's case becomes a redemption arc that never quite cleanses either of them. Turturro makes ordinary work into something profound.</p>
                
                <h3>Rikers as Character</h3>
                <p>The prison sequences are among television's most harrowing. Not because of violence (though there is that) but because of the mundane degradation—the waiting, the noise, the casual brutality of guards and prisoners alike. The show understands that incarceration is its own sentence regardless of guilt.</p>
                
                <h3>The Ending Question</h3>
                <p>Did Nasir do it? The show refuses to answer definitively, which frustrated some viewers. But the point isn't whether he's guilty—it's that the system would have processed him either way. The resolution score reflects this ambiguity, which is either frustration or artistry depending on your tolerance for uncertainty.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> A procedural that indicts the procedure. Ahmed and Turturro are extraordinary.</p>
