                <h2>Tom Hardy Goes Feral</h2>
                <p>Taboo is Tom Hardy's passion project—a gothic thriller about a man who returns from Africa with something dark inside him, seeking revenge against the East India Company in 1814 London. It's grim, atmospheric, and features one of Hardy's most intense performances.</p>
                
                <h3>James Keziah Delaney</h3>
                <p>Hardy plays Delaney like a coiled spring—communicating as much through grunts and glares as through dialogue. Everyone thinks he's mad. Maybe he is. He communicates with the dead, practices rituals, and carries scars both visible and not. It's a bravura performance of constraint and explosion.</p>
                
                <h3>The East India Company</h3>
                <p>The show's villain isn't a person—it's an institution. The East India Company functions as a proto-corporate entity: rapacious, bureaucratic, indifferent to human cost. Jonathan Pryce plays Sir Stuart Strange as the face of capitalism without conscience. The historical accuracy makes the corruption more chilling.</p>
                
                <h3>Atmosphere Over Plot</h3>
                <p>Taboo prioritizes mood over momentum. The fog-choked London streets, the candlelit conspiracies, the mud and blood—Steven Knight creates a world where violence feels inevitable. Some viewers found it slow; others found it immersive. The truth is somewhere between.</p>
                
                <h3>Waiting for Season Two</h3>
                <p>The resolution score reflects the incomplete nature—the show was designed as a multi-season arc, and season two has been "in development" for years. What exists is a complete chapter, but the larger story remains untold.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Atmospheric, intense, and committed. Hardy at his most feral.</p>
