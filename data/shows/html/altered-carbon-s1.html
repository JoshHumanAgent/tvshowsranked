                <h2>Cyberpunk with a Soul</h2>
                <p>Altered Carbon's first season is Netflix's most ambitious sci-fi—a neon-soaked noir where consciousness can be transferred between bodies, death is optional if you're rich, and a 250-year-old soldier wakes up in a new sleeve to solve a murder. The world-building is staggering; the story is almost good enough to match it.</p>
                
                <h3>The Premise</h3>
                <p>Humanity has spread to the stars, and everyone has a "stack"—a device that stores consciousness. Bodies are "sleeves," interchangeable and commodified. The rich (Meths, short for Methuselahs) live forever in cloned bodies. Everyone else rents bodies or dies when their stack is destroyed. It's capitalism weaponized against mortality.</p>
                
                <h3>Takeshi Kovacs</h3>
                <p>Joel Kinnaman plays the mercenary brought back after centuries of storage. The performance is appropriately haunted—Kovacs is a man out of time, haunted by a lost love, distrustful of everyone, lethal when necessary. The show uses his fish-out-of-water status to explore this future through fresh eyes.</p>
                
                <h3>Bay City, 2384</h3>
                <p>The production design is extraordinary. Bay City is Blade Runner's Los Angeles with new details—the AI hotels with their lonely proprieters, the ground-level squalor beneath floating Meth mansions, the weird beauty of bodies that don't match their occupants. Every frame is dense with world-building.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Season 1 Only?</h3>
                <p>The second season, with Anthony Mackie replacing Kinnaman, loses something essential. The world remains interesting, but the story becomes generic sci-fi action. Season 1 works because it's a focused murder mystery that uses its premise to explore class, identity, and mortality. The follow-up is just content.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Stunning world, solid story. Cyberpunk television done right—once.</p>
