                <h2>The Serious Side of Kelley</h2>
                <p>Before Boston Legal there was The Practice—David E. Kelley's serious legal drama. Same universe, completely different tone. Where Boston Legal played for laughs, The Practice played for keeps. Dylan McDermott led a firm that defended guilty clients because everyone deserves representation.</p>
                
                <h3>Ethical Morass</h3>
                <p>Every episode is an ethical puzzle. Can you defend someone you know is guilty? Should you? The Practice forces lawyers to choose between legal duty and moral certainty. The conceptual density score reflects a show that treats legal ethics as genuine dilemmas, not plot conveniences.</p>
                
                <h3>The Cast</h3>
                <p>McDermott, Lara Flynn Boyle, Camryn Manheim, Michael Badalucco, Steve Harris—a deep ensemble that won Emmys and made the show appointment television. Guest stars included future stars: a young Ryan Phillippe, a pre-fame Lucy Liu. Kelley's writing attracted talent.</p>
                
                <h3>The Decline</h3>
                <p>Eight seasons, but The Practice peaked early. Cast turnover and increasingly ridiculous cases undermined the show's seriousness. The resolution score reflects a series that knew when to stop—but didn't stop soon enough. Still, the first four seasons are essential legal drama.</p>
                
                <h3>The Successor</h3>
                <p>Boston Legal spun off from The Practice, taking James Spader's Alan Shore with it. The Practice was the serious parent; Boston Legal the eccentric child. Both are valuable. The Practice just hits harder.</p>
                
                <p class="verdict"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Legal drama that takes ethics seriously. Boston Legal's better half.</p>
