    "consensus_highlights": "A premium thriller adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's classic novel starring Eddie Redmayne and Lashana Lynch. With a £100 million budget across ten episodes filmed in Budapest, Vienna, and Croatia, the series delivers cinematic scope and genuine suspense. Redmayne's portrayal of the professional assassin earned a Golden Globe nomination, while the show became Sky's biggest original launch and Peacock's most-watched premiere of 2024. Director Brian Kirk leads a team that treats each episode as a feature film. Created by Ronan Bennett, the series updates Cold War material for contemporary audiences while maintaining the original's examination of professional killers and personal cost. Renewed for Season 2.",
