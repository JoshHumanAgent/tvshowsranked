# HOW TO RANK — The Rosetta Stone
*Read this EVERY TIME before ranking any show*

## THE FOUNDATION (LOCKED)

The 103 shows in `00-foundation-list.json` are **CANONICAL**.
- Scores are **NEVER** changed unless Josh explicitly says so
- This is the reference point for ALL comparisons
- These shows earned their ranks through careful evaluation

## THE SCORING SCALE (BE HARSH)

| Score | Label | Meaning | How Many Exist? |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **10** | Perfect | The gold standard, no meaningful flaws | 1 (GoT S1-4) |
| **9** | Incredible | Near-flawless, only minor imperfections | Very rare |
| **8** | Exceptional | Among the very best in television | 10-20 MAX |
| **7** | Very Good | Clearly stands out, memorable | MOST shows sit here |
| **6** | Good | Noticeably above typical TV | |
| **5** | Average | Competent but unremarkable | |

**DEFAULT ASSUMPTION:** Most shows start at 7 (Very Good) and move UP or DOWN based on evidence.

- Triple-check before allowing anything above 8.1

## CATEGORY-SPECIFIC RULES

### Characters & Acting (25% weight)
**Score 9-10:** Massive ensemble cast with perfect acting across the board
- Example: The Wire (dozens of fully realized characters)
- Example: The Sopranos (family + mafia + therapy + peripheral)
- Example: Breaking Bad (Walter, Jesse, Gus, Mike, Saul, Skyler, Hank...)

**Score 8-8.5:** 2-4 exceptional characters, tight cast
- Example: Better Call Saul (Jimmy, Kim, Mike, Nacho)

**Score 7-7.5:** 1-2 great characters, good but not transformative

**Score 6:** Adequate characters, nothing memorable

### World Building (15% weight)
Compare to: Game of Thrones, The Wire, Boardwalk Empire
- Does the world feel lived-in?
- Are there layers of society shown?
- Does it transcend the screen?

### Cinematography (5% weight)
Compare to: Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad, Chernobyl
- Must do something NEW or push boundaries to score 9+
- Most shows cap at 7-8

### Visual Spectacle (5% weight)
Compare to: Game of Thrones, Band of Brothers, Foundation
- Production value alone doesn't earn high scores
- Must be integral to storytelling

### Conceptual Density (15% weight)
Compare to: The Wire, Dark, The Expanse
- How many layers of meaning?
- Does it reward rewatching?
- Thematic depth?

### Narrative Drive (15% weight)
Compare to: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones S1-4
- Does every episode propel forward?
- Is it "just one more episode" compelling?

### Narrative Path & Resolution (25% weight)
Compare to: Breaking Bad, The Americans, The Shield
- Did it stick the landing?
- Does the journey pay off?
- A bad ending DESTROYS this score (see: Lost, Game of Thrones S8)

## THE RE-RANKING PROCESS

### Step 1: Compare to Foundation
Open `00-foundation-list.json`. Find shows with similar:
- Genre
- Era
- Scope
- Reception

### Step 2: Write the Breakdown First
- Characters: Who are the standouts? How many?
- World: Is it expansive or intimate?
- Cinematography: What's the visual language?
- Spectacle: Budget shown on screen?
- Concept: What's it actually about deep down?
- Drive: Is it propulsive or slow-burn?
- Resolution: Did it end? How?

### Step 3: Let Narrative Dictate Score
**DON'T force the narrative to fit a pre-existing score.**
If the breakdown says "2 great characters" → score IS 8 max.
The score follows the truth, not the other way around.

### Step 4: Cross-Reference
- Does this show deserve to be above X in the foundation?
- If it's scoring 8+, is it actually better than Ozark? Than Mad Men?
- When in doubt, score LOWER. Eights are rare. Nines are legendary.

---

## RED FLAGS (Automatic Demotions)

- **Bad ending:** Resolution score drops to 4-6 minimum
- **Only 1-2 good characters:** Characters caps at 8
- **New/unproven show:** Everything caps at 7.5 until it finishes
- **Comedy-heavy:** This is a DRAMA ranking — adjust expectations
- **Niche appeal:** Good for its audience ≠ good for everyone

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**A few correctly-ranked shows > many incorrectly-ranked shows.**

Take your time. Be harsh. Compare to the foundation.
The rankings are the point. Accuracy is everything.
