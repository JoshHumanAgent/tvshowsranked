## 🎯 THE MISSION

**Build the definitive ranking of SERIALIZED NARRATIVE DRAMAS.**

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

### 1. SERIALIZED ONLY (No Episodics)

**INCLUDE:** Story continues episode to episode (Breaking Bad, The Wire, Succession)
**EXCLUDE:** Procedural/case-of-the-week (House, Law & Order, CSI, NCIS)

Archived procedurals → `archived-procedural.json`

### 2. REGIONAL SCOPE

** ✅ INCLUDE:**
- Western (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, NZ)
- European (Spain, France, Germany, Scandinavia)
- Korean dramas (Goblin, Squid Game)
- Japanese/Chinese dramas

**❌ EXCLUDE:**
- Indian dramas → `archived-indian.json`
- Anime/animation (separate project)

### 3. FOUNDATION SHOWS ARE LOCKED

**97 shows in `00-foundation-list.json` — NEVER change without Josh's explicit approval.**

These are the calibration reference. All other shows are scored BY COMPARISON to these.

### 4. AI SCORING: BE HARSH

| Score | Meaning | Frequency |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 10 | Perfect | 1 show (GoT S1-4) |
| 9 | Incredible | VERY RARE |
| 8 | Exceptional | 10-20 MAX |
| 7 | Very Good | MOST shows |
| 6 | Good | Above average |
| 5 | Average | Competent |

**Default assumption:** Shows start at 7 and move UP or DOWN based on evidence.

**Top 10 is sacred:** Triple-check before allowing anything above 8.1.

### 5. CRITIQUE AI SCORES

AI-generated scores tend to be inflated. Always compare to foundation:

- Is this show better than Boardwalk Empire? (8.23)
- Is this show better than Deadwood? (8.18)
- If not, it shouldn't score higher.

**Red flags that lower scores:**
- Cancelled/no proper ending → Resolution drops to 4-6
- Only 1-2 great characters → Characters caps at 8
- Comedy/genre show → Expectations adjust
- New/unproven → Cap at 7.5 until finished

## 🔄 WORKFLOW

### Adding New Shows

1. **Check for duplicates** — Search ranked.json first
2. **Compare to foundation** — Find similar shows, check their scores
3. **Score each dimension** — Write breakdown first, score follows
4. **Calculate final** — Weighted average
5. **Update files** — ranked.json, index.json, create HTML
6. **Commit** — Git add, commit, push

### Rescoring AI Shows

When AI scores seem inflated:
1. Find foundation shows of similar genre/era
2. Compare dimension by dimension
3. Apply harshness — most shows belong at 6-7, not 8+
4. Question every 8 or 9

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES

**Site not updating?**
- `git status` → check commits
- `git push origin master` → sync
- Ctrl+F5 on site

**JSON parse errors?**
- Check for BOM (byte order mark): `if (content.charCodeAt(0) === 0xFEFF) content = content.substring(1);`

**index.json cards not showing?**
- Ensure all fields present: `char`, `world`, `cine`, `spect`, `conc`, `drive`, `resol`, `final`, `episodes`
