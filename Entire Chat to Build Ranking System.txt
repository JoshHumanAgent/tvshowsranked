### Comprehensive TV Show Ranking System Guideline This is a detailed, immersion-focused ranking system we've developed for evaluating TV shows. The goal is to identify shows that truly transport you into another world—one where everything feels real, consequential, meaningful, and unforgettable.

This is a thoughtfully constructed ranking system! I appreciate how it prioritizes immersion as the central criterion—that feeling of being transported into a show's world is often what separates truly great television from merely competent entertainment.

A few observations and questions:

Strengths of the system:

The weighting makes sense: Characters & Acting at 20% reflects how character investment drives emotional engagement
The distinction between Cinematography (craft/intentionality) and Visual Spectacle (scale/wow factor) is smart—they're related but different skills
The episode multiplier is a clever way to reward sustained excellence; maintaining quality across 60+ episodes is genuinely harder than a tight 8-episode limited series
Some considerations:

The 5 = average calibration is crucial and often where ranking systems break down. Most people instinctively score on a 7-10 scale. Are you planning to enforce this strictly?
Genre fairness: A show like Better Call Saul might score lower on Visual Spectacle by design (it's not trying for epic scale), while Game of Thrones might score lower on Gravitas in later seasons. The weighting helps here, but some shows are intentionally not pursuing certain categories.
The "fascination/extraordinariness" requirement in Characters is interesting—it seems to favor antiheroes and complex figures over more grounded protagonists. Is that intentional?
Narrative Drive's pacing criterion is well-framed ("judged by effectiveness, not speed")—this prevents bias against slow-burn shows like The Leftovers or Mad Men.
Would you like me to help you apply this to specific shows, refine any categories, or create a scoring template?

Umm yes so we have to make sure it's crucial that the scale doesn't get overblown SO5IS average 6 is good 7 is very very good 8 is exceptional 9 is incredible close to perfect but not quite minor perfections like maybe 99% good and 10 is absolutely perfect impossible to be better genre fairness so visual spectacle is how amazing is it to watch it like visually for example an image of a desert is not as well no a desert is maybe could could be quite good but let's just say uh so some examples would be things you would see Things you would see in everyday life would be a five like offices homes streets Modern Day stuff like just anything from like what would be normal to see for us and then shows that do large sets or expansive CG that actually looks good like for example you've got like if you can look at the screen and just say I've never seen that before that amazing that would get a much higher rank than the main street of an American town Yeah as far as the extraordinaryness of characters I think you have to have something that gives the character while Factor or the characters one is kind of hard like you said it's an interesting question to think about does it dramatic or extreme character make a better character not always I guess but then again we do have characters that we prefer over others I'm not quite sure how to rate the characters and that regard

You've raised some really important points. Let me work through these with you.

On the 5-10 Scale Discipline

Your calibration is clear and I'll hold to it strictly:

Score	Meaning
5	Average—competent, nothing special (most TV lives here)
6	Good—noticeably better than typical
7	Very good—memorable, stands out
8	Exceptional—among the best in its class
9	Incredible—99% perfect, only minor flaws
10	Perfect—literally impossible to improve
On Visual Spectacle Clarification

I think I understand now. You're measuring visual novelty and impressiveness—how often does the show put something on screen that makes you go "wow, I've never seen that" or "that's stunning"?

5 (baseline): Familiar, everyday visuals—offices, suburban homes, modern city streets. Competently shot but nothing you haven't seen.
6-7: Interesting locations or good production design—period settings, distinctive architecture, well-crafted sets.
8: Ambitious visuals that genuinely impress—large-scale practical sets, memorable VFX, landscapes or imagery that stick with you.
9-10: Unprecedented—visuals you literally pause to admire. Dragons that feel real, space battles with weight, imagery that becomes iconic.
So Breaking Bad's desert vistas might hit 7-8 (striking, distinctive), while Game of Thrones at its peak hits 9+ (dragons, massive battles, fantasy architecture you'd never see elsewhere).

On the Character "Extraordinariness" Problem

This is the trickiest question. You're right that dramatic ≠ better, but we do prefer some characters over others. Let me propose a reframe:

Instead of "extraordinary" meaning extreme or dramatic, what if we measure memorability and interiority?

Do you think about this character when you're not watching?
Do they have a rich inner life you feel you understand (or are compellingly mysterious)?
Years later, can you recall who they were as a person, not just what they did?
This lets quieter characters score high. For example, Kim Wexler in Better Call Saul isn't a dramatic antihero, but she's deeply memorable—you understand her values, her conflicts, her suppressed impulses. She lingers.

Whereas a functional character like... say, a generic cop protagonist in a procedural—they might be likable, well-acted, but you forget them. They're a vessel for plot, not a person you knew.

Proposed Character Scoring Factors:

Depth/Interiority: Do they feel like real people with inner lives, contradictions, histories?
Memorability: Will you remember them (not just their actions) years later?
Investment: Do you genuinely care what happens to them?
Ensemble breadth: How many characters achieve the above? (More = harder = more impressive)
Performance: Does the acting disappear into the person?
This way, Walter White scores high (dramatic, transformative, unforgettable), but so could a character like Peggy Olson from Mad Men (quieter arc, but deeply interior and memorable).

Does this framing feel right, or do you want to push on the character question more?

Yeah Kim wakesler was an amazing character I was constantly wondering what was going on with her in the show never really confirmed it she was constantly a battle with being good staying on the straightenero but then constantly being tempted into Jimmy's shenanigans and I originally thought it was because she loved Jimmy but it turned out I think it was more to do with being a rebal. But then again I'm not sure  Anyway the point is that her character is amazing right I don't know why maybe it's like inner depth, or perhaps it's characters that are feel like they actually are trying to make decisions and the decisions are based on who they are and that is conflicted sometimes I'm not sure

Jan 4
You've actually just articulated something really insightful about what makes characters compelling, even if it felt uncertain as you said it.

What You Identified About Kim

You described a character who:

Made you wonder—you were constantly trying to understand her motivations
Had genuine internal conflict—the straight-and-narrow vs. the thrill of Jimmy's schemes
Surprised you with depth—you thought it was love, then realized it might be rebellion, and you're still not entirely sure
Felt like she was making real decisions—not plot-driven choices, but choices rooted in who she is
That last point is key. You said "characters that feel like they actually are trying to make decisions and the decisions are based on who they are."

Proposed Character Framework: Agency + Interiority + Mystery

Factor	What It Means
Agency	Their choices feel theirs—driven by personality, values, flaws—not by what the plot needs
Interiority	You sense a rich inner life, even when it's not explained. They feel like they exist when the camera isn't on them
Productive Mystery	You keep wondering about them. Not confusion (bad writing), but genuine "what's really going on with them?" that rewards attention
Coherent Complexity	They have contradictions, but those contradictions make sense as a person—like Kim being ethical yet tempted by chaos
Kim scores incredibly high on all four. You believe she's a person making real choices based on competing parts of herself. And crucially, the show trusts you to wonder rather than spelling it out—that's the "productive mystery."

Contrast with Weaker Characters

A weak character might be:

Plot-driven: They do things because the story needs them to, not because it feels true to them
Explained too neatly: Their motivation is stated outright, no mystery, nothing to chew on
Static: No internal conflict, no evolution, no sense of battling with themselves
So Maybe the Character Criteria Becomes:

Agency: Do their choices feel authentically theirs?
Interiority: Do you sense depth beneath the surface?
Productive Mystery: Do you find yourself wondering about them?
Coherence: Do their contradictions make human sense?
Investment: Do you care what happens to them?
Ensemble Breadth: How many characters achieve this?
Performance: Does the acting serve all of the above invisibly?
Does this capture what you were reaching toward with Kim? We could test it against other characters you know well to see if it holds up.

yeah nice thanks

Jan 4
Great! So to summarize where we've landed:

Visual Spectacle — Novelty and impressiveness of what's on screen

5 = Everyday familiar visuals (offices, suburbs, modern streets)
6-7 = Interesting locations, good production design
8 = Ambitious visuals that genuinely impress
9-10 = Unprecedented, iconic imagery you pause to admire
Characters & Acting — Agency, interiority, mystery, coherence

Do their choices feel authentically theirs?
Do you sense depth and wonder about them?
Do contradictions make human sense?
How many characters achieve this?
Does the acting disappear into the person?
Scale Discipline

5 = Average
6 = Good
7 = Very good
8 = Exceptional
9 = 99% perfect
10 = Literally cannot be improved
The rest of the original framework stays intact—World-Building, Cinematography, Narrative Drive, Thematic Resonance, Dimensionality/Scope, Gravitas, and the Episode Multiplier.

Want me to put together an updated master document with these refinements? Or would you like to test the system by scoring a show you know well—maybe Better Call Saul since we've been discussing Kim?

Tv ranking system

So the problem was having before is I think that each show wasn't given enough thought and therefore the rankings were out because most of the shows weren't really judged properly so you almost need to go show it at a time giving each one good good thought and judgment and then eventually get to a system that is ranked correctly now unfortunately that's gonna be difficult because there's maybe at least a hundred shows that need to be ranked that you could consider would be you know in the top how would you approach ranking making sure that each Show gets its as an accurate ranking as possible

Jan 4
That's a really important point. Rushing through 100+ shows leads to inconsistent scoring and gut-feel rankings that don't hold up. Here's how I'd approach it:

The Core Problem

When you score many shows quickly, you end up with:

Recency bias (shows you watched recently feel more vivid)
Inconsistent calibration (your sense of "7" drifts as you go)
Surface-level assessment (you remember plot, not the actual feel of watching)
Proposed Approach: Deliberate Batching with Anchors

Step 1: Establish Anchor Shows First

Pick 5-6 shows you know extremely well and score them carefully, one at a time. These become your calibration anchors—reference points for every future score.

For example:

One show you consider near-perfect (9+ territory)
One you consider great but flawed (7-8 range)
One you think is good but not exceptional (6-7)
One that's fine, just average (5-6)
Every time you score a new show, you compare it to these anchors: "Is this show's cinematography better or worse than [Anchor Show]?"

Step 2: One Show at a Time, Fully

For each show:

Go category by category
Recall specific scenes/moments that justify each score
Write brief notes explaining why (keeps you honest)
Compare against anchors before finalizing
This might take 10-15 minutes per show, but the rankings will actually mean something.

Step 3: Batch by Confidence

Prioritize shows you remember well. Shows you watched years ago and feel hazy on—flag them for rewatch or accept lower confidence in those scores.

Step 4: Periodic Recalibration

After every 15-20 shows, revisit your anchors. Ask: "Do these scores still feel right relative to what I've just ranked?" Adjust if needed.

Practical Question for You

Do you want to start by picking your anchor shows? We could score 4-5 of them thoroughly—one at a time with real deliberation—and use those as the foundation for everything else.

Which shows do you know well enough to serve as anchors across different quality tiers?

OK well i know breaking bad pretty we.... at the top like universally accepted

Jan 4
Breaking Bad is a perfect anchor for the top tier. Let's score it carefully, category by category.

Take your time with each one—I'll ask you to think about specific moments and justify the score against our criteria.

Breaking Bad

Episodes: 62 (so ×1.05 multiplier)

1. Characters & Acting (20%)

Think about: Walt, Jesse, Gus, Mike, Hank, Skyler, Saul, Marie, even Todd and the Salamancas.

Using our framework:

Agency: Do their choices feel authentically theirs?
Interiority: Do you sense depth, wonder about them?
Productive Mystery: Do you keep thinking "what's really going on with them?"
Coherent Complexity: Do contradictions make human sense?
Ensemble breadth: How many characters hit this level?
Performances: Do actors disappear into the roles?
What's your gut score, and can you think of specific moments or characters that justify it? For example—who are the standout characters that have that Kim Wexler quality we talked about, where you're genuinely wondering about them and their choices feel real?

how would you rate those characters and I'll critique

Jan 4
Alright, here's my assessment:

Walter White

Agency: 10 — Every choice feels authentically his. The show is essentially a study in his decisions. From refusing Gretchen and Elliott's money to "I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it."
Interiority: 10 — You sense the ego, resentment, pride, and buried rage long before it surfaces. His inner life drives everything.
Productive Mystery: 9 — You're constantly wondering "how much is Heisenberg and how much was always Walt?" The show never fully answers it, which is the point.
Coherent Complexity: 10 — His contradictions (loving father / monster, brilliant / petty, cowardly / bold) all make human sense as expressions of wounded pride.
Performance: 10 — Cranston disappears completely. You forget Malcolm in the Middle ever existed.
Jesse Pinkman

Agency: 9 — His choices feel real, though he's often reactive to Walt. But when he does choose (refusing to cook, trying to save kids, finally turning), it's deeply him.
Interiority: 10 — The most emotionally transparent character. You feel everything he feels. His trauma is palpable.
Productive Mystery: 7 — Less mysterious than Walt—you generally understand Jesse. But his moral compass keeps you wondering "will he break or hold on?"
Coherent Complexity: 9 — Burnout druggie with a conscience. Self-destructive but desperately wants to be good. Makes complete sense.
Performance: 10 — Aaron Paul is Jesse. Iconic.
Gus Fring

Agency: 10 — Every move is calculated and his. His patience and revenge are entirely self-directed.
Interiority: 9 — You sense enormous depth beneath the mask. The backstory with Max is devastating precisely because Gus hides so much.
Productive Mystery: 10 — The definition of "what's really going on with him?" The mask rarely slips, but when it does (box cutter, "last chance to look at me"), it's chilling.
Coherent Complexity: 9 — Cold businessman / vengeful lover. The contradiction is the character.
Performance: 10 — Giancarlo Esposito is terrifyingly controlled.
Mike Ehrmantraut

Agency: 9 — His code is his own. He does what he does for his reasons (granddaughter, professionalism).
Interiority: 9 — The weariness, the "I've seen too much," the buried grief over his son—all felt, rarely stated.
Productive Mystery: 8 — You wonder about his past, his limits. Better Call Saul expanded this, but even in BB there's depth.
Coherent Complexity: 9 — Criminal with a code, killer who loves his granddaughter. Completely believable.
Performance: 10 — Jonathan Banks is effortless.
Hank Schrader

Agency: 9 — His doggedness is entirely him. The obsession with Heisenberg, the refusal to let go—authentic.
Interiority: 8 — The bravado masking vulnerability (panic attacks, ego). You sense what's beneath the bluster.
Productive Mystery: 7 — Less mysterious, more "watching someone unravel/rise." But the question of whether he'll catch Walt keeps you hooked.
Coherent Complexity: 8 — Loud, macho, but fragile. Cop who genuinely believes in justice. Works.
Performance: 9 — Dean Norris nails the comedy and tragedy.
Skyler White

Agency: 8 — Her choices feel real—protecting the family, then complicity, then fear. Sometimes constrained by Walt's gravity.
Interiority: 8 — You sense her exhaustion, moral conflict, love curdling into fear. Often misread by viewers, but the depth is there.
Productive Mystery: 6 — Less "wonder about her" and more "watch her cope." Understandable, but not as magnetic.
Coherent Complexity: 8 — Enabler and victim. Pragmatist who crossed lines she hates. Human.
Performance: 9 — Anna Gunn is excellent, especially in later seasons.
Saul Goodman

Agency: 8 — He's a fixer, so somewhat reactive, but his sleaze and survival instincts are entirely his.
Interiority: 7 — In BB alone, he's more comedic relief with hints of depth. (BCS changes this dramatically.)
Productive Mystery: 6 — In BB, he's entertaining but not someone you deeply wonder about.
Coherent Complexity: 7 — Sleazy lawyer with street smarts. Works, but not deeply layered in BB.
Performance: 9 — Bob Odenkirk is perfect for the role.
Secondary Characters (Todd, Salamancas, Marie, etc.)

Generally strong. Todd is quietly terrifying (that flat affect). The Salamancas are memorable archetypes. Marie is functional but less deep.

My Overall Score: 9.5

Justification: 5-6 characters with exceptional depth, agency, and performance. Walt and Gus are all-time great TV characters. Jesse is emotionally devastating. Mike and Hank are fully realized. Even the weaker characters (Skyler, Saul in BB) are well above average. Ensemble depth across 62 episodes is remarkable.

Not a 10 because a few supporting characters are thinner, and some (Skyler, Marie) don't quite reach that "productive mystery" level—they're realistic and well-acted but not fascinating in the same way.

What's your critique? Too high? Too low? Any characters I misjudged?

nah spot on

Jan 4
Great. Let's keep moving.

2. World-Building (10%)

The world of Breaking Bad: Albuquerque, the meth trade, the cartel, the DEA, Los Pollos Hermanos, the criminal underworld hierarchy.

Think about:

Does it feel like a real place with life beyond the plot?
Are the rules of this world consistent (how the drug trade works, how law enforcement operates, cartel politics)?
Could you navigate it? Does it have texture—the feel of the desert, the suburban emptiness, the industrial spaces?
My take:

Score: 8

Justification:

Albuquerque itself becomes a character—the desert, the strip malls, the sun-bleached mundanity. It feels real and specific, not Generic American City.
The drug trade logistics are believable and detailed (distribution, precursor chemicals, money laundering, cartel hierarchy).
Los Pollos Hermanos as a front is fully realized.
The DEA operations feel authentic.
Why not higher?

It's grounded realism, not a sprawling constructed world. We don't get deep into cartel history, Albuquerque culture beyond what the plot needs, or a sense of the city's broader life.
Compare to The Wire (Baltimore as a living organism across institutions) or Game of Thrones (entire civilizations with histories)—those are 9-10 world-building.
Breaking Bad's world serves the story excellently, but it's not trying to be an expansive universe.
Does that feel right to you, or would you push it higher/lower?

Yeah I think maybe a seven would be better I think it's very good memorable and clearly stands out it's not exceptional among the very best and it's class

Jan 4
Agreed. 7 it is.

The world-building is strong and distinctive—Albuquerque feels real, the drug trade mechanics are believable—but it's not trying to be an expansive world. It's a backdrop that serves the character drama, not a universe you could get lost exploring on its own.

3. Cinematography (10%)

The visual craft—framing, lighting, movement, color, composition. How the camera tells the story.

Think about:

The signature Breaking Bad shots: time-lapses, POV from inside objects (trunk, beneath glass, inside a bag), the desert wide shots
Color symbolism (Walt's shift from beige to black, Marie's purple)
How tension is built visually (the slow push-ins, the stillness before violence)
My take:

Score: 9

Justification:

Distinctive visual identity—you can recognize Breaking Bad from a single frame
Intentional and meaningful choices throughout (the color work alone is studied in film schools)
Time-lapses, unusual POVs, and composition that make mundane moments feel loaded with dread
The cinematography elevates the material—it's not just serving the story, it's adding meaning
Why not 10?

It's masterful, but I'd hesitate to call it literally impossible to improve. Some might argue shows like Hannibal or certain prestige films push visual craft even further into painterly territory.
Your thoughts?

agree

Jan 4
4. Visual Spectacle (10%)

The novelty and impressiveness of what's on screen. How often do you see something that makes you go "wow"?

Think about:

The desert landscapes
The meth lab setups (superlab, RV)
Explosions, the plane crash, Gus's face
But also—most of the show is in homes, offices, parking lots, fast food restaurants
My take:

Score: 7

Justification:

The desert is striking and used beautifully—it's not everyday imagery for most viewers
Memorable visual moments: the pink teddy bear, Gus walking out with half a face, the train heist, Hank's shootout with the cousins
The superlab is impressive production design
Why not higher?

Most of the show takes place in mundane spaces—suburban homes, the car wash, Los Pollos Hermanos, parking lots. Deliberately so.
It's not trying for epic scale. No dragons, no battles, no vast CGI worlds.
The spectacle that exists is effective, but it's punctuation, not the norm
Compare to something like Game of Thrones where nearly every episode has something visually unprecedented. Breaking Bad earns its "wow" moments, but they're sparse by design.

Does 7 feel right?

6 Good—noticeably better than typical TV but without the Cinematography it would just be any Every Day normal thing no grand sets or epic sci-fi landscape or anything Although it does look good most of that down to the cinematography a lot of the time is spent and walt's house or someone else's house which is just a modern house

Jan 4
You're right. The distinction you're making is important—Visual Spectacle is about what is being shown, not how it's shot. And what's being shown is mostly:

Walt's suburban house
Jesse's house
The car wash
Los Pollos Hermanos
DEA offices
Various parking lots and streets
All everyday locations. The desert is nice, and there are occasional standout moments (the superlab, the train, Gus's face), but those are exceptions. Without the cinematography elevating it, you're looking at pretty standard American suburbia and workplaces.

Score: 6

Good production design, locations serve the story, occasionally impressive—but fundamentally grounded in the everyday. Not what you'd pause and admire for sheer visual novelty.

5. Narrative Drive (15%)

How the story pulls you forward. Stakes, momentum, pacing.

Think about:

Did you need the next episode?
The slow-burn tension vs. explosive payoffs
How it escalates season by season
Any filler or drag?
My take:

Score: 9

Justification:

Masterful escalation—each season raises stakes logically
The tension is almost unbearable at times (Crawl Space, Face Off, Ozymandias)
Slow moments earn their place—they build dread, not boredom
Very little filler across 62 episodes
The need-to-binge pull is intense
Why not 10?

Some early Season 2 and parts of Season 3 drag slightly on rewatch. The fly episode is divisive.
Your thoughts?

I think this is one of the things probably the thing that it does the best I don't think I've seen better in any show it's hard to actually know how they achieve this there's something about the show that is just insanely watchable I think it's perfect but like the flying episode does certainly not pull away from its perfect pacing if anything the odd spot of slowness feels like a weekend away which is just perfect and there's only one that could have been more but there isn't I don't know how it could be better in this regard so 10

Jan 4
Sold. You've articulated exactly why it deserves the 10.

The fly episode isn't a flaw—it's a breath. And the fact that there's only one moment like that across 62 episodes, and even that one feels like intentional pacing rather than drag, is remarkable. The show is relentlessly compelling without being exhausting.

Score: 10

6. Thematic Resonance (15%)

The ideas explored and how deeply they land. Does it make you think/feel differently? Does it linger?

Think about:

Pride, ego, masculinity
The lies we tell ourselves about our motivations
Family—what we do "for" them vs. what we do to them
Transformation and moral decay
Consequences
My take:

Score: 9

Justification:

"I did it for me" is one of the most resonant character admissions in TV history
The exploration of ego disguised as sacrifice is profound and universal
Makes you examine your own self-justifications
Lingers—years later, people still debate Walt's nature
Why not 10?

It's deep, but focused. It's primarily a character study of one man's corruption. Compare to something like The Wire which tackles systemic institutional failure across society, or The Leftovers which grapples with grief, faith, and meaning at an almost spiritual level.
Does that feel right, or do you think it hits 10?

yeah 9

Jan 4
7. Dimensionality/Scope (10%)

The breadth of topics, threads, tones, locations, and ideas handled well. How many different elements intersect?

Think about:

What threads does Breaking Bad juggle? Family drama, drug trade, cat-and-mouse with DEA, cartel politics, partner dynamics, business operations, moral philosophy
Tones: dark comedy, thriller, tragedy, domestic drama
Does it feel expansive or focused?
My take:

Score: 7

Justification:

It handles several threads well: family, crime, DEA investigation, cartel, the Walt/Jesse relationship
Tonal range is there—genuine dark humor alongside tragedy
But it's fundamentally focused. It's Walt's story. Everything orbits him.
Why not higher?

Compare to The Wire (drugs, docks, schools, politics, media—five distinct worlds with their own casts and themes intersecting)
Or Game of Thrones (politics, war, family dynasties, religion, horror, romance across continents)
Breaking Bad is deliberately tight. That's a strength for other categories, but here it limits the scope.
It's very good at what it does, but it's not trying to be sprawling.

Does 7 feel right?

yeah

Jan 4
8. Gravitas/Weight (10%)

Does it feel like serious art? Do events carry consequence? Do moments linger and demand respect?

Think about:

The "sit in silence after the episode" feeling
Moments that stayed with you for years
Does the show treat its own events with weight? Do choices have real consequences?
My take:

Score: 10

Justification:

Ozymandias alone justifies this. Widely considered one of the greatest episodes of television ever made. Devastating.
Consequences are real. Actions ripple. Jane's death leads to the plane crash. Walt letting Jane die poisons everything with Jesse. Hank's death is earned through five seasons of buildup.
Moments that linger forever: "I am the one who knocks," Gus walking out with half a face, "My name is ASAC Schrader," crawl space breakdown, "I watched Jane die"
The finale feels heavy. Walt's death, Jesse's scream driving away—it sits with you.
The show demands to be taken seriously and earns that demand completely.
I can't think of how this could be improved. Every major moment lands with full weight. There's no undercutting, no cheap reversals, no "it was all a dream." What happens, matters.

Does 10 feel right, or would you pull it back?

for sure

Jan 4
Great. Let's tally it up.

Breaking Bad — Final Score

Category	Weight	Score
Characters & Acting	20%	9.5
World-Building	10%	7
Cinematography	10%	9
Visual Spectacle	10%	6
Narrative Drive	15%	10
Thematic Resonance	15%	9
Dimensionality/Scope	10%	7
Gravitas/Weight	10%	10
Base Score Calculation:

(9.5 × 0.20) + (7 × 0.10) + (9 × 0.10) + (6 × 0.10) + (10 × 0.15) + (9 × 0.15) + (7 × 0.10) + (10 × 0.10)
= 1.90 + 0.70 + 0.90 + 0.60 + 1.50 + 1.35 + 0.70 + 1.00
= 8.65
Episode Multiplier: 62 episodes → ×1.05

Final Score: 8.65 × 1.05 = 9.08

That feels right for a show widely considered one of the greatest ever made. It's not inflated—it loses points on world-building, visual spectacle, and scope because it's a focused character study, not an expansive universe. But where it excels (narrative drive, gravitas, characters), it's essentially perfect.

Good first anchor. What's next—another top-tier show, or something in the 7-8 range to calibrate the middle?

No I think you're pretty much onto it now I'm pretty sure you'll be able to judge these on your own how do you think you would be able to proceed would you be able to do a quickly and many of them or do you want to do them one at a time

Jan 4
Honestly, I think the careful one-at-a-time approach is what makes this work. When we rushed through shows before, the rankings were off because each show wasn't given proper thought.

But now that we've calibrated with Breaking Bad, I can move faster while staying rigorous. Here's what I'd propose:

Efficient but Thorough

I could score shows in batches of 3-5 at a time, giving each one:

A score for each category with brief justification
Comparison to Breaking Bad as anchor ("World-building not as expansive, so lower than BB's 7")
Final calculation
Then you review the batch—agree, critique, adjust. We lock them in and move on.

This way we're not spending 20 minutes per show, but we're also not rushing through 50 in one go and ending up with meaningless numbers.

What I Need From You

A list of shows to rank. You mentioned around 100—do you have that list, or do you want to brainstorm which shows belong in the pool?

Also: are there any shows you know really well that you want to go deep on like we did with Breaking Bad? Those become additional anchors and make every other ranking more reliable.

Okay I've got grok to print out some shows, for us to add to our possible list of things that need to be sorted do you think there's anything in here that is missed that would potentially be worth putting in  The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Game of Thrones, Succession, The Simpsons, Seinfeld, Friends, The Office (US), The Office (UK), Twin Peaks, The West Wing, Lost, 24, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The X-Files, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Frasier, Cheers, All in the Family, MAS*H, I Love Lucy, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Fawlty Towers, Blackadder, Veep, Parks and Recreation, 30 Rock, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, South Park, Better Call Saul, Fargo, True Detective, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, The Shield, Boardwalk Empire, Justified, The Americans, Friday Night Lights, Battlestar Galactica (2004), Firefly, Fleabag, Atlanta, BoJack Horseman, Rick and Morty, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Chernobyl, Band of Brothers, The Crown, Downton Abbey, Sherlock, The Leftovers, Hannibal, Mr. Robot, Dark, Mindhunter, Narcos, Ozark, The Boys, Stranger Things, The Mandalorian, Westworld, Ted Lasso, The Bear, Schitt's Creek, Modern Family, Barry, What We Do in the Shadows, Abbott Elementary, Only Murders in the Building, The Good Place, Louie, Insecure, Watchmen (2019), The Twilight Zone, Doctor Who, The Prisoner, Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, ER, Grey's Anatomy, House M.D., Dexter, Sons of Anarchy, True Blood, Sex and the City, The Larry Sanders Show, Freaks and Geeks, My So-Called Life, Homicide: Life on the Street, St. Elsewhere, Roots, The Decalogue, Planet Earth II, Blue Planet II, Cosmos (both versions), The World at War, Life on Earth, Shogun (2024), The Last of Us, Squid Game, Money Heist (La Casa de Papel), Pachinko, Derry Girls, Normal People, It's a Sin, Reservation Dogs, Russian Doll, The Underground Railroad, When They See Us, The Queen's Gambit, Maid, Beef, Severance, Andor, House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, Yellowjackets, Euphoria, Lovecraft Country, Pose, Killing Eve, Broadchurch, The Night Manager, Olive Kitteridge, Big Little Lies, Sharp Objects, The Handmaid's Tale, Homeland, Billions, Ray Donovan, Vinyl, Rome, Carnivàle, Angels in America, The Corner, Show Me a Hero, Generation Kill, The Pacific, John Adams, Elizabeth I, Pride and Prejudice (1995), Brideshead Revisited, The Singing Detective, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, I, Claudius, Upstairs Downstairs, The Forsyte Saga, Twin Peaks: The Return, Scenes from a Marriage (2021), Your Honor, The Undoing, Mare of Easttown, Dopesick, The Dropout, Inventing Anna, Pam & Tommy, WeCrashed, The Staircase, Black Bird, The Offer, Tokyo Vice, Slow Horses, Silo, Foundation, For All Mankind, See, Ted Lasso, Schmigadoon!, Mythic Quest, Acapulco, Loot, The Afterparty, Bad Sisters, Shrinking, Hijack, The Morning Show, Dickinson, See, Servant, Truth Be Told, Lisey's Story, Defending Jacob, Little America, Amazing Stories, Calls, Roar, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey, Five Days at Memorial, Black Bird, Lessons in Chemistry, The Changeling, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, The Buccaneers, Criminal Record, Masters of the Air, Manhunt, Palm Royale, Dark Matter, Presumed Innocent, Lady in the Lake, The Sopranos (again for emphasis—no duplicates intended), The Wire, etc.

One Question

This list mixes very different things—sitcoms, prestige dramas, documentaries, limited series, sketch shows. Our ranking system is built for immersive drama.

Do you want to:

Rank everything together (comedies will score low on gravitas, documentaries don't have "characters" the same way)
Separate by category (dramas vs comedies vs documentaries)
Focus on dramas/prestige only for now
What's your preference?

yeah Hmm yeah let's keep it to the drama Prestige for now also make sure it's live action no documentaries

Jan 4
Got it. Live action prestige drama only. Let me filter the list down:

The Core Pool

The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Game of Thrones, Succession, Twin Peaks, The West Wing, Lost, 24, The X-Files, Better Call Saul, Fargo, True Detective, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, The Shield, Boardwalk Empire, Justified, The Americans, Friday Night Lights, Battlestar Galactica (2004), Firefly, Fleabag, Chernobyl, Band of Brothers, The Crown, Downton Abbey, Sherlock, The Leftovers, Hannibal, Mr. Robot, Dark, Mindhunter, Narcos, Ozark, The Boys, Stranger Things, The Mandalorian, Westworld, The Bear, Barry, Watchmen (2019), House M.D., Dexter, Sons of Anarchy, True Blood, Homicide: Life on the Street, Shogun (2024), The Last of Us, Squid Game, Money Heist, Pachinko, Normal People, It's a Sin, The Underground Railroad, When They See Us, The Queen's Gambit, Maid, Beef, Severance, Andor, House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, Yellowjackets, Euphoria, Killing Eve, Broadchurch, The Night Manager, Big Little Lies, Sharp Objects, The Handmaid's Tale, Homeland, Rome, Carnivàle, Generation Kill, The Pacific, John Adams, Twin Peaks: The Return, Mare of Easttown, Dopesick, Tokyo Vice, Slow Horses, Silo, For All Mankind, The Morning Show, Black Bird, Masters of the Air, Presumed Innocent, The Night Of

Adding from my suggestions:

Peaky Blinders, The Expanse, Halt and Catch Fire, Rectify, The Knick, Penny Dreadful, Black Sails, Vikings, The Terror (S1), Utopia (UK), Line of Duty, Happy Valley, Gomorrah, ZeroZeroZero, Oz, The Plot Against America

That's roughly 95 shows.

Do you want me to start working through them in batches? I'd suggest starting with the ones most likely to be top-tier (Sopranos, Wire, Better Call Saul, Leftovers, etc.) to establish more anchors, then work down.

Yeah I don't know I still feel like we're missing some

That gets us well over 200. Want me to compile the full master list into a document so we can start systematically working through them?

yeah

Jan 4

Created a file, read a file

Done. That's around 220+ unique shows organized by:

Already Ranked (Breaking Bad as anchor)
Top Priority (the likely top-tier shows to score next as anchors)
Major Prestige Drama (HBO classics through 2025)
Premium Cable (Showtime, FX, AMC, Starz)
Streaming Originals (Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+, Hulu, Disney+, Paramount+)
Broadcast/Network Prestige (Lost, Twin Peaks, The West Wing, etc.)
British Prestige (BBC/ITV/Channel 4)
International (European and Asian)
Sci-Fi/Genre Prestige
Additional/Miscellaneous
There's also a scoring progress table at the bottom to track as we go.

How do you want to proceed? I'd suggest:

Next anchor: Score The Sopranos carefully (like we did Breaking Bad) since it's the other consensus GOAT
Then maybe one mid-tier anchor (something in the 7-8 range) for calibration
Then I can start working through batches more efficiently
Or if you'd prefer, I can just start working through the top priority list and you review my scores?

Tv shows to rank
Document · MD 
ok where do you wana start? wana do a broad cull first?

Jan 4
Yeah, a broad cull makes sense. Let's remove shows that probably don't belong in a serious "best prestige drama" ranking—either because they're not really prestige, they're too flawed, or they're just not in the same conversation.

Proposed Cuts:

Too mainstream/procedural (not really prestige):

The Walking Dead (quality collapsed)
Power
Spartacus
Tulsa King
Mayor of Kingstown
NCIS-style stuff if any snuck in
Quality fell off a cliff:

Westworld (S1 great, then disaster)
Dexter (original run—finale ruined it, though Resurrection might redeem)
True Blood (fun but messy)
Killing Eve (S1 great, then lost the plot)
Heroes (if it were on here)
Too light/not really drama:

The Mandalorian (fun but thin)
Ahsoka
Obi-Wan Kenobi (pretty weak)
Sugar (more genre exercise)
Too early to judge / not enough substance:

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (not out yet?)
Several 2025 shows with only one season
Probably not top-200 material:

Vinyl (HBO misfire)
Luck (cancelled early)
Magic City
Brotherhood
Hunters
Liaison
See (mixed reception)
What do you think?

Should I also flag shows you haven't seen so we can either cut them or note them as "unranked - not watched"? No point scoring shows neither of us can properly evaluate.

No I trust your evaluation now and I'll have a look over after you do another valuation I definitely want to keep the ones that I haven't seen this is half the reason why I'm making the list but yeah you're cuts already look pretty good so all right let's cut down that list of 220 to the serious candidates don't be too harsh though like we should probably still have a list of around 100

Jan 4
Alright, let me do a thoughtful cull. I'll keep shows that are either genuinely excellent OR have strong enough reputations/moments that they deserve evaluation, even if flawed. Cutting the clearly weak, the not-really-prestige, and the too-thin.

THE CUT LIST (Removing ~100):

Quality Collapsed / Ruined Legacy:

Westworld (S1 is 9/10, then unwatchable)
Dexter (original - finale poisoned it)
True Blood (trashy fun, not prestige)
Killing Eve (S1 only good)
The Walking Dead (became zombified itself)
Heroes (if anywhere)
Lost (controversial - but I'll keep it, it's historically significant)
Not Really Prestige Drama:

Power
Spartacus
Tulsa King
Mayor of Kingstown
The Mandalorian (fun, not deep)
Ahsoka
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Outlander (more romance)
Hunters (messy)
HBO Misfires / Too Thin:

Vinyl
Luck
The Undoing (forgettable thriller)
The Outsider (started strong, fizzled)
Lovecraft Country (ambitious but messy)
Streaming Filler:

See (mixed)
Liaison
Sugar
The Changeling (divisive)
Monarch: Legacy of Monsters
Lady in the Lake
Where's Wanda? (too light)
The Dropout (fine, not top tier)
Inventing Anna
You (guilty pleasure, not prestige)
Too New / Unproven:

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (not out)
Several 2025 single-season shows that need more time
Murderbot (too new)
Prime Target (too new)
Your Friends & Neighbors (too new)
British Shows - Cutting the Lesser:

Ripper Street (solid, not essential)
Humans (good, not great)
Bodyguard (fun thriller, thin)
International - Trimming:

Money Heist: Korea (remake)
Suburra (lesser Gomorrah)
Network - Cutting Dated/Weaker:

NYPD Blue (dated)
St. Elsewhere (historically important but dated)
ER (good but very long, procedural)
Miscellaneous Cuts:

Magic City
Brotherhood
Boss
Fringe (good, not prestige tier)
Dark Winds (solid, not essential)
Hell on Wheels (decent, not top 100)
Turn: Washington's Spies (niche)
Let me make the refined list now:


Created a file, read a file

Culled it down to 105 core shows plus about 14 "on the bubble" that could be added back.

The tiers roughly indicate expected quality:

Tier 1: The pantheon (likely 8.5+)
Tier 2: Elite prestige (likely 8+)
Tier 3: Modern acclaimed (7.5-9 range)
Tier 4-9: Mixed bag (6-8.5 range)
Where do you want to start?

Option A: Score The Sopranos next as our second anchor (go deep like Breaking Bad)

Option B: I rapid-fire score Tier 1 (the 9 remaining pantheon shows) and you review

Option C: I batch-score a whole tier and you critique

My recommendation is Option A—nail down The Sopranos since it and Breaking Bad are the two poles most rankings revolve around. Then we'll have solid calibration for everything else.

Tv shows final candidates

option b

Jan 4
Alright, rapid-fire Tier 1. I'll give each show the full breakdown but move efficiently. Here we go:

2. The Sopranos
Episodes: 86 (×1.05)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9.5	Tony is the template for prestige antiheroes—rage, self-loathing, charm, menace. Carmela, Christopher, Paulie, Junior, Livia, Melfi—deep bench of fascinating people. Everyone has interiority.
World-Building	8	North Jersey mob world feels completely lived-in. The restaurants, the Bing, the family dynamics, the hierarchy. Not as expansive as some, but textured and real.
Cinematography	7	Competent, occasionally inspired (dream sequences), but largely workmanlike. TV of its era—not its strength.
Visual Spectacle	5	Suburban New Jersey, strip clubs, hospitals, therapy office. Deliberately mundane. Not what it's going for.
Narrative Drive	8	Slower burn than Breaking Bad. Some episodes meander. But when it locks in, it's gripping. The patience is intentional but occasionally tests you.
Thematic Resonance	10	The American dream rotting from within. Therapy as self-deception. Violence as inheritance. Masculinity as prison. It invented prestige TV themes. Profound and lasting.
Dimensionality/Scope	8	Mob life, family drama, psychology, American culture, intergenerational trauma. Juggles many threads across 86 episodes.
Gravitas	10	The weight is crushing. Deaths linger. The finale still sparks debate. Every major moment sits with you. Invented the grammar of serious TV.
Base Score: (9.5×0.20) + (8×0.10) + (7×0.10) + (5×0.10) + (8×0.15) + (10×0.15) + (8×0.10) + (10×0.10) = 1.90 + 0.80 + 0.70 + 0.50 + 1.20 + 1.50 + 0.80 + 1.00 = 8.40

Final Score: 8.40 × 1.05 = 8.82

3. The Wire
Episodes: 60 (×1.05)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9	Omar, Stringer, McNulty, Bunk, Avon, Bubbles, Kima—huge ensemble, all feel real. Slight ding: spread so wide that some don't get the depth of a Walter White.
World-Building	10	The gold standard. Baltimore as living organism—docks, schools, politics, newsrooms, corners. Each institution fully realized. You could live there.
Cinematography	6	Deliberately unglamorous, almost documentary. Effective but not beautiful. Intentional choice, but still not a strength.
Visual Spectacle	5	Row houses, project towers, city hall, newsrooms. Working-class Baltimore. No spectacle by design.
Narrative Drive	7	Slow. Very slow. Rewards patience enormously but demands investment. Season 2 loses some viewers. Not designed for binging.
Thematic Resonance	10	The greatest critique of American institutions ever put on screen. Systemic failure, the death of the American city, the game that never changes. Devastating and true.
Dimensionality/Scope	10	Five seasons, five worlds (drugs, docks, politics, schools, media)—all intersecting. Unmatched breadth executed brilliantly.
Gravitas	10	Weight of a great novel. Deaths matter. The tragedy is institutional, not individual. Stays with you forever.
Base Score: (9×0.20) + (10×0.10) + (6×0.10) + (5×0.10) + (7×0.15) + (10×0.15) + (10×0.10) + (10×0.10) = 1.80 + 1.00 + 0.60 + 0.50 + 1.05 + 1.50 + 1.00 + 1.00 = 8.45

Final Score: 8.45 × 1.05 = 8.87

4. Better Call Saul
Episodes: 63 (×1.05)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	10	Jimmy, Kim, Chuck, Mike, Nacho, Howard, Lalo—every single one has agency, interiority, productive mystery. Kim might be the best-written character in TV history.
World-Building	8	Shares Breaking Bad's Albuquerque but adds the legal world, cartel operations. Textured and believable.
Cinematography	9.5	Arguably better than Breaking Bad. The compositions, the color work, the visual storytelling. Masterful and distinctive.
Visual Spectacle	6	Same as BB—courtrooms, offices, desert. Slightly more visual ambition with cartel scenes. Still grounded.
Narrative Drive	9	Slower than BB but earns every minute. The patience creates unbearable tension. Chicanery, Plan and Execution, the finale—perfectly paced.
Thematic Resonance	9	Identity, self-deception, the tragedy of potential wasted, whether people can change. More intimate than BB but equally profound.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Tighter focus than BB even—primarily Jimmy's story with Mike's parallel track. Rich but narrow by design.
Gravitas	10	Chuck's death, Howard's death, Kim leaving, the finale—devastating. Earned weight through patience. The courtroom scenes alone.
Base Score: (10×0.20) + (8×0.10) + (9.5×0.10) + (6×0.10) + (9×0.15) + (9×0.15) + (7×0.10) + (10×0.10) = 2.00 + 0.80 + 0.95 + 0.60 + 1.35 + 1.35 + 0.70 + 1.00 = 8.75

Final Score: 8.75 × 1.05 = 9.19

5. Mad Men
Episodes: 92 (×1.05)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9.5	Don, Peggy, Joan, Pete, Roger, Betty—extraordinary depth. Don's emptiness, Peggy's rise, Pete's arc from villain to sympathetic. Slow-burn character development.
World-Building	9	1960s Madison Avenue brought to life. The offices, the homes, the fashion, the social dynamics. Period detail is immaculate.
Cinematography	8	Elegant, composed, very deliberate. Beautiful framing, excellent use of space and color. Stylish without being flashy.
Visual Spectacle	6	Gorgeous period production design, but it's offices and apartments. The spectacle is in the style, not scale.
Narrative Drive	7	Glacially slow. Deliberately so. Some seasons meander. Not about plot—about character erosion and growth over time. Demands patience.
Thematic Resonance	9	Identity, reinvention, the American dream as performance, the 60s as turning point. What does authenticity mean? Quietly devastating.
Dimensionality/Scope	8	Advertising, social change, gender, class, family—covers a lot of ground across a decade of American history.
Gravitas	9	Quieter weight than BB or Sopranos. The devastation is cumulative. The carousel scene, the finale—earns its emotion.
Base Score: (9.5×0.20) + (9×0.10) + (8×0.10) + (6×0.10) + (7×0.15) + (9×0.15) + (8×0.10) + (9×0.10) = 1.90 + 0.90 + 0.80 + 0.60 + 1.05 + 1.35 + 0.80 + 0.90 = 8.30

Final Score: 8.30 × 1.05 = 8.72

6. The Leftovers
Episodes: 28 (×0.95)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9	Kevin, Nora, Matt, Laurie—deeply human, flawed, searching. Carrie Coon gives one of TV's best performances. Smaller cast but profound depth.
World-Building	8	Post-departure world is eerie and believable. The cults, the government response, the social fabric fraying. Specific and haunting.
Cinematography	8	Beautiful, often surreal. The hotel episode, the Australia sequences—visually ambitious and distinctive.
Visual Spectacle	7	Some genuinely striking imagery—the International Assassin episode, the finale. More visually ambitious than most dramas.
Narrative Drive	8	Season 1 is slower; seasons 2-3 are propulsive and gripping. Wild swings that somehow work.
Thematic Resonance	10	Grief, faith, meaning, letting go. The most emotionally devastating show I can think of. It changes you. The finale is transcendent.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Focused—it's about grief and its manifestations. Doesn't try to be sprawling. Intimate rather than broad.
Gravitas	10	Crushing. Every episode of seasons 2-3 has moments that break you. The weight is spiritual, existential.
Base Score: (9×0.20) + (8×0.10) + (8×0.10) + (7×0.10) + (8×0.15) + (10×0.15) + (7×0.10) + (10×0.10) = 1.80 + 0.80 + 0.80 + 0.70 + 1.20 + 1.50 + 0.70 + 1.00 = 8.50

Final Score: 8.50 × 0.95 = 8.08

7. Deadwood
Episodes: 36 + movie (×1.00)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9.5	Swearengen, Bullock, Alma, Doc, Trixie, Calamity Jane—Shakespearean depth. Swearengen's soliloquies to the severed head. Ian McShane is towering.
World-Building	9	The camp feels completely real—the mud, the businesses, the social hierarchy forming in real-time. A town being born.
Cinematography	8	Gritty, tactile, occasionally beautiful. The mud and blood feel real. Serves the material excellently.
Visual Spectacle	7	The camp itself is impressive production design. Period detail, the vistas. More spectacle than most character dramas.
Narrative Drive	8	Dense, Shakespearean pacing. The dialogue demands attention. Not fast, but compelling. Cancelled too early.
Thematic Resonance	9	Civilization vs. chaos, capitalism as original sin, community forming from self-interest. The poetry of profanity.
Dimensionality/Scope	8	Politics, commerce, law, morality, community—all through one town's formation. Rich intersection of threads.
Gravitas	9	Weight of tragedy. Wild Bill's death, the political machinations, Swearengen's complexity. Feels Shakespearean.
Base Score: (9.5×0.20) + (9×0.10) + (8×0.10) + (7×0.10) + (8×0.15) + (9×0.15) + (8×0.10) + (9×0.10) = 1.90 + 0.90 + 0.80 + 0.70 + 1.20 + 1.35 + 0.80 + 0.90 = 8.55

Final Score: 8.55 × 1.00 = 8.55

8. Six Feet Under
Episodes: 63 (×1.05)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9	The Fisher family—Nate, David, Ruth, Claire, Brenda—all deeply flawed, all deeply human. Messy, real, evolving.
World-Building	7	A funeral home in LA. The world is intimate—family, relationships, death as constant presence. Not expansive, but specific.
Cinematography	7	Solid, occasionally dreamlike with the death visions. Serves the material without distinction.
Visual Spectacle	5	Funeral home, houses, LA streets. Domestic settings. Not its concern.
Narrative Drive	7	Character-driven, sometimes meandering. Some seasons drag. But the cumulative effect is powerful.
Thematic Resonance	9	Death, family, sexuality, meaning. What does it mean to live knowing you'll die? Quietly profound.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Focused on family, death, relationships. Intimate rather than broad. Does what it does deeply.
Gravitas	10	The finale is arguably the greatest in TV history. The accumulated weight of five seasons pays off devastatingly.
Base Score: (9×0.20) + (7×0.10) + (7×0.10) + (5×0.10) + (7×0.15) + (9×0.15) + (7×0.10) + (10×0.10) = 1.80 + 0.70 + 0.70 + 0.50 + 1.05 + 1.35 + 0.70 + 1.00 = 7.80

Final Score: 7.80 × 1.05 = 8.19

9. The Americans
Episodes: 75 (×1.05)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9	Philip and Elizabeth—two of TV's most complex protagonists. Their marriage, their conflict, their children. The handlers, Martha—everyone has depth.
World-Building	8	1980s Cold War America, Soviet ideology, the spy tradecraft. Meticulous period detail and procedure.
Cinematography	7	Solid, workmanlike, occasionally tense. Not its primary strength.
Visual Spectacle	5	Suburban Virginia, safe houses, parking garages. Deliberately mundane—that's the point. Spies in the suburbs.
Narrative Drive	8	Slow-burn tension that builds across seasons. The Martha storyline, the finale season—gripping when it wants to be.
Thematic Resonance	9	Marriage, identity, loyalty, ideology, parenthood. What do we owe our countries vs. our families? The ending is morally devastating.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Spy thriller + marriage drama + period piece. Focused but layered.
Gravitas	9	The accumulated weight of their choices. The finale—the parking garage, the train—is perfect and crushing.
Base Score: (9×0.20) + (8×0.10) + (7×0.10) + (5×0.10) + (8×0.15) + (9×0.15) + (7×0.10) + (9×0.10) = 1.80 + 0.80 + 0.70 + 0.50 + 1.20 + 1.35 + 0.70 + 0.90 = 7.95

Final Score: 7.95 × 1.05 = 8.35

10. Succession
Episodes: 39 (×1.00)

Category	Score	Justification
Characters	9.5	The Roy family—Logan, Kendall, Shiv, Roman, Connor—plus Tom and Greg. Each one magnetic, broken, watchable. The ensemble dynamics are extraordinary.
World-Building	8	Ultra-wealthy media dynasty world. The yachts, the offices, the power. Feels authentic and grotesque.
Cinematography	8	Distinctive—handheld intimacy, the zooms, finding reactions. Creates unease and immediacy. Very intentional style.
Visual Spectacle	7	Yachts, penthouses, private jets, Tuscany—the rich world is visually impressive if not epic.
Narrative Drive	9	Compulsively watchable. Every episode feels like a bomb about to go off. The boardroom battles, the family dinners—gripping.
Thematic Resonance	9	Wealth as poison, family as trap, the impossibility of escaping your parents, power and emptiness. Biting and true.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Focused on one family, one company. Does it brilliantly but intentionally narrow.
Gravitas	9	Logan's death, Kendall's breakdowns, the finale—devastating. The tragedy of people who have everything except what matters.

Alright, let's do The Sopranos properly.

The Sopranos
Episodes: 86 (×1.05)

1. Characters & Acting (20%)

Tony, Carmela, Christopher, Paulie, Silvio, Junior, Livia, Melfi, Adriana, Bobby, Janice, Johnny Sack, Ralphie, Tony B...

Using our framework:

Agency: Do their choices feel authentically theirs?
Interiority: Do you sense depth, wonder about them?
Productive Mystery: Do you keep thinking "what's really going on with them?"
Coherent Complexity: Do contradictions make human sense?
Ensemble breadth: How many characters hit this level?
Performance: Does the acting disappear into the person?
My take: 9.5

Tony Soprano is the template. The rage, the charm, the self-loathing, the panic attacks, the mother issues—he's endlessly fascinating. You're constantly wondering: can he change? Does he want to? Is therapy helping or just giving him better tools for manipulation? Gandolfini disappears so completely you forget he's acting.

Carmela is extraordinary—complicit, in denial, loving, materialistic, morally wrestling. Her scenes with the psychiatrist who tells her to leave are devastating.

Christopher's arc—the wannabe, the addict, the betrayed surrogate son—is tragic and coherent.

The depth goes deep into the bench: Paulie's insecurity masked by violence, Junior's fading relevance, Livia as pure malevolence, Adriana's doomed innocence.

Why not 10? Arguably could be. But across 86 episodes, some supporting characters are thinner (some of the later-season additions). And the sheer density of extraordinary characters in Better Call Saul edges it slightly.

What's your take on the characters? Too high? Too low? Anyone I'm over or underrating?

less detail ill just ask questions about The score is that you gave it for each one if needed so just give me your quick ranking on The Sopranos and then ask questions and we can move through this quicker

Any of those feel off?

Yeah I think the cinematography is not that good maybe it was good for the time but it's aged poorly it's like average or good change my mind, the other seem pretty good

Jan 4
You're probably right. It was shot like quality TV of its era—competent, functional, occasionally good with the dream sequences—but nothing that holds up as distinctive craft today.

Compare it to something like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul where you could identify the show from a single frame. The Sopranos doesn't have that. It's "well-shot TV drama" not "visual artistry."

I'll drop it to 6—good, noticeably better than typical, but not exceptional.

Yeah hmm I think visual speak to corners to go up a little bit for the way that it shoots the slums and a lot of the environments are not actually typical because they're extremely poor I think it was actually probably pretty difficult to get that I mean like I don't know how difficult that would be but it certainly not something that is mundane or every day, as it's more of an eye opener now it's not like visually stunning but it certainly is a Spectacle so I would probably give it a 7

Jan 4
That's a fair point. It's not spectacular in the blockbuster sense, but you're seeing environments most viewers have never seen—the corners, the projects, the docks, the vacant row houses. There's a "window into another world" quality even if it's not beautiful. It's showing you something real that most people never encounter.

Better Call Saul (63 eps → ×1.05)
Category	Score	Reason
Characters & Acting	10	Jimmy, Kim, Chuck, Mike, Nacho, Howard, Lalo—all have deep agency and interiority. Kim might be TV's best-written character.
World-Building	8	Shares BB's Albuquerque, adds legal world and cartel hierarchy. Textured and believable.
Cinematography	9.5	Arguably better than BB. Compositions, color work, visual storytelling are masterful.
Visual Spectacle	6	Courtrooms, offices, desert. Cartel scenes add some scale but still grounded.
Narrative Drive	9	Slower than BB but earns every minute. Tension is unbearable—Chicanery, Plan and Execution.
Thematic Resonance	9	Identity, self-deception, wasted potential, whether people can change. Intimate but profound.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Tighter focus—primarily Jimmy's story with Mike's parallel track. Rich but narrow by design.
Gravitas	10	Chuck's death, Howard's death, Kim leaving, the finale. Devastating and earned.
Base: 8.75 → Final: 9.19

Any adjustments?

Yeah it's hard not to give a 10 for characters apart from I can think of Game of Thrones which is probably better I mean like Jimmy and Kim are obviously 10s but chuck Mike not Joe Howard not 10 maybe eight or nines not even that if you really look at the scale and the scoring scale it's more like very good to exceptional which is six or seven sorry seven eight so yeah I pull back on the characters there are only giving 10 for like four plus ten characters like the world building for political so I don't think it deserves an 8 it's very good I don't know but an eight sort of similar to Breaking Bad  yeah there is this fine

Jan 4
You're right. Let me recalibrate:

Characters: Jimmy and Kim are genuine 10s. Chuck is fascinating but more limited in scope. Mike is great but we've seen him before in BB. Nacho is very good. Howard is solid. Lalo is entertaining but more archetypal villain. So you've got 2 extraordinary characters, maybe 3-4 very good ones. That's more like a 9 than a 10.

World-Building: It's essentially the same world as Breaking Bad with the legal layer added. Good, but not expansive or particularly distinctive beyond what BB established. 7 feels right.

Base: 8.30 → Final: 8.72

Any issues?

This is a kind of a tough one I feel like mad men always gets really high ratings but for me personally I just didn't think it was that good I thought it was okay but this is not really about what I think about Mad Men this is more about getting our scale rates so I'll try and be as objective as possible I think the characters Don and peggy are 9/10 to the rest lower for sure you gotta remember our scalar is a nine is 99 perfect well 99% close to perfect which is pretty high Minor and perfections remember when you got a nine it's hard to argue with any of that the world building was fantastic yeah I think dimensionality and scope needs to be reduced a bit and gravitas it's kind of a personal thing so I don't know it's kind of hard to judge that one actually

Jan 4
Fair points. Let me adjust:

Characters: Don and Peggy are genuinely exceptional (9 territory). Joan, Roger, Pete are very good but not at that level—maybe 7-8 each. Betty is divisive. So the ensemble average pulls it down a bit.

Dimensionality/Scope: It's really about one industry, one milieu. The social change stuff is backdrop more than fully explored threads. It's focused rather than sprawling.

Gravitas: I'll keep it but maybe drop slightly—it's weighty but in a quieter, less visceral way than Sopranos or BB.

Yeah interesting again characters is too high yeah that's pretty on to apart from the characters I think the characters are not nines almost none are

Jan 4
You're right. Let me reconsider:

Kevin is compelling but often reactive—things happen to him. Nora is the standout but even she is more about performance than deep interiority in the way Kim Wexler has. Matt is interesting but one-note at times (suffering priest). Laurie is solid. The Guilty Remnant are more symbols than characters.

The show's power comes more from its themes and atmosphere than from deeply fascinating characters you wonder about. It's emotionally devastating but not because of character complexity—it's the situation and the feeling.

Visual Spectacle	7	The Red Room, the Pacific Northwest. Iconic imagery.
Narrative Drive	6	Solved the mystery too early, S2 meanders badly. Brilliant peaks, frustrating valleys.
Thematic Resonance	9	Darkness beneath small-town America, trauma, the subconscious. Influential and haunting.

How does Tier 2 look? Any adjustments before Tier 3?

I don't know why but I feel like succession is just too high I'm not sure why I feel that way I think this a big difference between incredible and exceptional and maybe that's some of that problems well these things eating Nines when perhaps they should only get an 8 I mean like it's exceptional among very best in class but incredible 99% perfect it's kind of very subjective I guess yeah I can't even argue with it right there's just no way on this planet Game of Thrones is worse than succession it's just there's something about this that's not right

Jan 4
You're touching on something important. Let me think about this.

Game of Thrones at its peak (seasons 1-4) is probably the most immersive television ever made. The problem is seasons 5-8 dragged it down. But even averaging that out, the highs are SO high—and the sheer ambition and execution of world, spectacle, scope is unmatched.

Succession is very good, but it's also... smaller? It's one family, one company, sharp dialogue, great performances. But is it incredible? Or is it very good executed excellently?

I think the issue is I gave Succession too many 9s. Let me reconsider:

Characters: 9 feels right—they're magnetic
Narrative Drive: 9 → maybe 8? It's compulsive but repetitive—Kendall rises, Kendall falls, repeat
Thematic Resonance: 9 → maybe 8? It's biting but not profound—it's saying "rich people are broken" for four seasons
Gravitas: 9 → maybe 8? It's weighty but in a satirical way—does it stay with you like Sopranos or BB?
Revised Succession:

Category	Score	Reason
Characters & Acting	9	The Roys are magnetic and broken. Extraordinary ensemble.
World-Building	8	Ultra-wealthy media world. Authentic and grotesque.
Cinematography	8	Distinctive handheld style. Creates unease.
Visual Spectacle	7	Yachts, penthouses, jets. Impressive not epic.
Narrative Drive	8	Compulsive but somewhat repetitive structure.
Thematic Resonance	8	Wealth as poison. Biting but not deeply profound.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	One family, one company. Narrow by design.
Gravitas	8	Weighty moments but satirical distance softens it.
Base: 7.95 → Final: 7.95

That drops it below Game of Thrones (8.98), which feels more correct.

Does that sit better?

I think that other seasons bring it down is not a thing that we should do it should be judged each season what without the other seasons so if there are one to four seasons that are fantastic in they should be given full credit and then we just say we just leave out the ones that are not so you just say don't watch them or then not worthy you know like I think each sees in is a different thing so like for example like it's different than like in a movie where the first half of the movie is great and then the second half is trash this is not the same thing you can't judge a Show based on all of its season so yeah okay so reshuffled the T1 and tier 2's and to just one list at the moment of the top shows you can take out your brief descriptions just to save space and then reshuffle based on what we've just talked about

Good point. A show's best seasons are complete works—you can stop watching after season 4 of GoT and have a masterpiece. Let me rescore Game of Thrones for seasons 1-4 only, then combine and rank.

Jan 4
The Shield (88 eps → ×1.05)
Category	Score	Reason
Characters	9	Vic Mackey is an all-timer—monstrous yet compelling, you root for him despite everything. Shane's arc from loyal sidekick to tragic downfall is devastating. The Strike Team dynamic is electric. Aceveda, Dutch, Claudette—the supporting cast all have real depth and agency.
World-Building	7	Farmington feels real—gangs, politics, the Barn. Gritty LA cop world. But it's a contained world, not expansive.
Cinematography	6	Pioneered the handheld gritty look that defined 2000s cop shows. Intentionally rough and urgent. Effective but not beautiful.
Visual Spectacle	5	Police stations, interrogation rooms, LA streets. Mundane by design—this isn't prestige glamour.
Narrative Drive	9	The lies compound relentlessly. Every season raises stakes. You're constantly wondering how they'll get out of this one. The finale is a masterclass in payoff.
Thematic Resonance	9	Does the end justify the means? What does corruption cost? Vic "wins" but loses everything that matters. The tragedy of believing your own justifications.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Cops, gangs, city politics, family. Focused on the Strike Team but branches effectively.
Gravitas	10	The finale is one of TV's best. Shane's murder-suicide, Vic's hollow "victory," Ronnie's betrayal face. It earns every ounce of devastation across 7 seasons.
Why it ranks where it does: The Shield is underseen but its finale rivals Breaking Bad's. Vic Mackey walked so Walter White could run. It loses points on visual craft but its character work and thematic payoff are elite.

Halt and Catch Fire (40 eps → ×1.00)
Category	Score	Reason
Characters	9	The show's secret weapon. Cameron Howe is one of TV's great characters—abrasive, brilliant, self-destructive, deeply human. Donna's arc from supportive wife to ruthless executive is remarkable. Joe starts as a Don Draper knockoff and becomes something more broken and real. Gordon's tragedy sneaks up on you. The Cameron/Donna relationship is TV's best female friendship—complex, competitive, loving, devastating.
World-Building	8	The tech revolution from garages to boardrooms. 1983 to 1994. It feels authentic—the excitement, the betrayals, the boom-bust cycles.
Cinematography	7	Solid period recreation. Nothing flashy but competent and occasionally lovely.
Visual Spectacle	5	Offices, garages, early computers. Mundane tech world—not what you watch it for.
Narrative Drive	8	Each season reinvents itself (PC clone → gaming → online → web). Keeps it fresh. Builds cumulative momentum across the series.
Thematic Resonance	9	What do we sacrifice for innovation? Ambition vs. relationships. The thing you build vs. the people you build it with. The finale's message—it's the people, not the product—is earned beautifully.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	Tech industry across a decade, but primarily through four people's intersecting lives. Focused but rich.
Gravitas	9	Gordon's death. The finale. The accumulated weight of a decade of partnership, betrayal, love, and loss. Quietly devastating.
Why it ranks where it does: Criminally underseen. It's the best show about what ambition costs and what matters when the work is done. Low on spectacle but high on character and emotional payoff.

Rome (22 eps → ×0.95)
Category	Score	Reason
Characters	8	Pullo and Vorenus are wonderful—one a lovable brute, the other rigid honor collapsing. Their friendship anchors the chaos. Caesar, Atia (deliciously scheming), Marc Antony (charismatic mess), Octavian (cold rise)—rich ensemble. Cancelled before full potential.
World-Building	10	Ancient Rome as a living city—the graffiti, the slaves, the religious rituals, the politics, the dirt. You smell it. HBO spent $100M making this world breathe. Best historical world-building on TV.
Cinematography	7	Solid, serves the spectacle. Some beautiful compositions but TV craft of its era.
Visual Spectacle	9	Rome itself is the spectacle. The Forum, the triumphs, the battles. Unprecedented TV production design at the time. You're there.
Narrative Drive	8	Historical inevitability provides momentum—you know Caesar dies, but how we get there grips. Season 2 compressed too much (cancellation looming).
Thematic Resonance	8	Republic dying into Empire. Honor vs. survival. Class and power. The personal cost of history's great turns.
Dimensionality/Scope	8	Politics, war, religion, class, family, sexuality—all woven through 22 episodes. Ambitious scope.
Gravitas	8	Deaths land hard. Vorenus's tragedy, Caesar's fall. Historical weight adds gravitas.
Why it ranks where it does: Cancelled too soon—this could have been a top-10 show with more seasons. The world-building is unmatched for historical drama. Loses points on episode count multiplier and slightly compressed storytelling.

True Detective S1 (8 eps → ×0.90)
Category	Score	Reason
Characters	9	Rust Cohle is an all-timer—nihilist philosopher, broken man, secretly the most moral person in the room. McConaughey's performance is transcendent. Marty is the "normal" guy who's actually more compromised. Their dynamic across two timelines is mesmerizing.
World-Building	8	Louisiana bayou as character—the swamps, the evangelical churches, the poverty, the rot beneath the surface. Tangible and oppressive.
Cinematography	10	Cary Fukunaga directed all 8 episodes. The 6-minute tracking shot through the projects is legendary. Every frame is composed with cinematic precision. This looks like a film, not TV.
Visual Spectacle	8	The bayou, Carcosa, the biker underworld, that tracking shot. Striking imagery throughout—not scale but craft.
Narrative Drive	9	Two timelines braided perfectly. The interrogation frame creates constant tension. You need to know what happened. Propulsive despite being dialogue-heavy.
Thematic Resonance	9	Time as a flat circle. Pessimism vs. hope. The darkness at the heart of institutions. Can one good act matter against infinite darkness? The finale's "light is winning" lands because it's earned.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	Two detectives, one case, one region. Deliberately narrow—that's the point. It's a character study through a crime lens.
Gravitas	9	The weight of cosmic horror meeting human evil. The years of damage on these men. The finale earns its emotion through restraint.
Why it ranks where it does: Its base score (8.60) is elite—top 5 quality. But the 0.90 multiplier for only 8 episodes drops it significantly. It's essentially a perfect mini-season, but the system rewards sustained excellence. If it had maintained this quality for 30+ episodes, it would be top 5 all-time.

Does this help clarify the rankings? Any scores you want to adjust?

fair enough

Done! 119 shows ranked. Want me to save this to a file?

Look through this list just to see if we've got any obvious problems it looks pretty good I mean the obvious ones are obvious is Mr Robot and battlestar galacticare super surprised that they're high and the top ten also lost in the top ten I don't know maybe for the first couple of seasons I guess it was absolutely awesome the top 10 should be extremely difficult to get into let's have some thoughts about that before we we do it go any further and any other maybe you have a look over and see if there's anything that looks at a place just looking at the overall list

Jan 4
You're right to flag those. Let me think through this:

Top 10 Concerns
Mr. Robot (8.62 - #7) I gave it a 10 for cinematography which boosted it significantly. The framing is genuinely revolutionary for TV. But is the show top 10 all-time? Season 2 drags badly. Season 4 is great but it's inconsistent overall. Elliot is an extraordinary character but the supporting cast is thinner. I think I overrated it—probably belongs in the 7.8-8.0 range.

Battlestar Galactica (8.61 - #8) The episode multiplier (1.05 for 75 eps) is helping it a lot. Seasons 1-2 are genuinely elite. Season 3 is uneven. Season 4 and the finale are divisive—many hate the ending. I gave it 9 for themes and gravitas which might be generous given how it lands. Probably belongs more in the 8.0-8.2 range.

Lost (8.45 - #10) Same issue—huge episode count (121 eps) means ×1.05 multiplier. Seasons 1-3 are extraordinary. Season 6 and the finale are polarizing. The mystery-box storytelling didn't fully pay off. Should it be top 10? Probably more like 7.8-8.0 territory.

The Expanse (8.87 - #5) This one surprises me too looking back. I gave it 10 for world-building which is fair—it's incredible sci-fi worldbuilding. But characters at 8? Some are flat. Narrative drive at 8? It can drag. 62 episodes getting the 1.05 multiplier is pushing it high. Probably belongs around 8.0-8.2.

Other Potential Issues
Babylon Berlin (8.45 - #9) - Is it really top 10 material? Great show but elite tier?

The Bureau (8.31 - #13) - Underseen, might be correctly rated but feels high

The Crown (8.14 - #20) - Some seasons are weaker. 8.14 might be slightly generous.

My suggestion: Rescore Mr. Robot, Battlestar, Lost, and The Expanse more critically. The top 10 should probably be:

Game of Thrones (S1-4)
Breaking Bad
The Wire
Better Call Saul
The Sopranos
Deadwood
The Americans
Mad Men
The Shield
Six Feet Under
These are the consensus prestige dramas that hold up completely. Thoughts?

Yeah I agree

Better? Top 5 is now the unassailable consensus greats. Want me to look at Babylon Berlin and The Bureau too, or does this feel right?

Wow now we have battle on Berlin as sex right Under The Sopranos which I've never seen it but I'm surprised let's work on this top 20 it's really important and first of all the top yeah let's work on the top 20 I want you to re-evalue away some of these that look odd

Jan 4
Let me flag the ones that look odd in the top 20 and re-evaluate:

Concerns in Top 20:
Babylon Berlin (#6 at 8.45) - Above The Shield, The Americans, Deadwood, Mad Men? It's a good show but is it really better than these? I've likely overrated the world-building and spectacle of Weimar Berlin.

The Bureau (#9 at 8.31) - Excellent spy drama but above Deadwood and Mad Men? It's underseen for a reason—it's great but not transcendent.

Shogun 2024 (#10 at 8.31) - One season, 10 episodes. Is it really top 10 all-time already? The multiplier (×0.95) is helping but it's unproven.

Gomorrah (#13 at 8.21) - Above Six Feet Under? It's intense but repetitive. Characters blur together across seasons.

Andor (#15 at 8.17) - 12 episodes, one season. Great but top 15 all-time?

The Handmaid's Tale (#18 at 8.11) - Later seasons are widely criticized as repetitive and misery porn. Should S1 quality carry the whole show?

Let me rescore these:

Babylon Berlin (36 eps → ×1.00)
Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	8	7	Good but not extraordinary depth
World-Building	10	9	Weimar Berlin is great but not Wire-level

Narrative Drive	6	5	Spins wheels for seasons, frustrating

That top 10 now looks like a legitimate "greatest of all time" list. Thoughts?

OK this is going to get repeated of maybe but I'm sorry for that but I want you to go over each one individually again and really consider I'll put you on deep thinking mode and really consider each score and our scoring scale and just keeping in mind that a nine is 99% almost perfect and eight exceptional among very business class and a seven is very good in memorable you've got the list probably so do the top 20 all over again to go through each one and have a real deep think about whether it really deserves the ranking that it has and if some are underrated if some overrated etc let's get this 20 top 20 really right

Let me go through each of the top 20 one by one with deep consideration of our scale:

1. Game of Thrones S1-4 (40 eps → ×1.00)
Current: 9.35

Category	Current	Reconsidered	Reasoning
Characters	9	9	Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime, Tywin, Arya, Ned, Joffrey, The Hound, Littlefinger, Varys—this is one of TV's deepest ensembles. But is it 99% perfect? Some characters are thinner (Robb is bland, Catelyn frustrating, Daenerys inconsistent). 9 is fair but not higher.
World-Building	10	10	Westeros is impossible to improve. History, religions, cultures, geography—fully realized. This earns the 10.
Cinematography	8	8	Improved dramatically. Battle episodes are masterful. Exceptional for TV. 8 is right.
Visual Spectacle	10	9	Groundbreaking for TV but not literally impossible to improve. Later seasons and other shows have matched it. 9.
Narrative Drive	10	10	S1-4 is relentlessly propulsive. Every episode earns the next. Red Wedding, Ned's death—this is perfect plotting. 10 is earned.
Thematic Resonance	9	8	Power corrupts, honor kills, the game consumes all. Strong but themes are more implied than deeply explored. Not 99% perfect thematically. 8.
Dimensionality/Scope	10	10	Politics, war, family, religion, horror, romance across continents. Unmatched. 10.
Gravitas	10	10	Ned, Red Wedding, Oberyn—moments that shook the culture. 10 is earned.
Revised Base: (9×.20)+(10×.10)+(8×.10)+(9×.10)+(10×.15)+(8×.15)+(10×.10)+(10×.10) = 9.20 Final: 9.20

2. Breaking Bad (62 eps → ×1.05)
Current: 9.08

Category	Current	Reconsidered	Reasoning
Characters	9.5	9	Walt, Jesse, Gus, Mike, Hank—extraordinary. But 9.5 is awkward. Is it better than The Sopranos' ensemble? Comparable. 9 for consistency.
World-Building	7	7	Albuquerque, the drug trade—believable but not expansive. Very good, not exceptional. 7 is right.
Cinematography	9	9	The desert shots, time-lapses, compositions—distinctive and masterful. 99% perfect? Close. 9.
Visual Spectacle	6	6	Suburban homes, desert, car wash. Good but everyday. 6 is right.
Narrative Drive	10	10	Possibly the most propulsive drama ever made. Each season escalates perfectly. 10.
Thematic Resonance	9	9	Pride, transformation, self-deception, "I did it for me." Deep and lasting. 9.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	7	Focused on Walt's story. That's its strength but limits scope. 7.
Gravitas	10	10	Ozymandias is TV's peak. Every death matters. 10.
Revised Base: (9×.20)+(7×.10)+(9×.10)+(6×.10)+(10×.15)+(9×.15)+(7×.10)+(10×.10) = 8.55 Final: 8.55 × 1.05 = 8.98

3. The Wire (60 eps → ×1.05)
Current: 8.98

Category	Current	Reconsidered	Reasoning
Characters	9	8	Omar, Stringer, McNulty, Bunk, Bubbles—memorable. But spread across five seasons and five worlds means some are thinner. It's exceptional ensemble work but not 99% perfect. 8.
World-Building	10	10	Baltimore as living organism—docks, schools, politics, corners. The gold standard. 10.
Cinematography	6	6	Deliberately unglamorous, documentary-style. Effective but not beautiful. 6.
Visual Spectacle	7	7	The projects, the corners—window into another world. Not everyday. 7.
Narrative Drive	7	7	Slow. Very slow. Demanding. Rewarding but not propulsive. 7.
Thematic Resonance	10	10	The greatest critique of American institutions. Devastating truth. 10.
Dimensionality/Scope	10	10	Five worlds intersecting. Unmatched breadth. 10.
Gravitas	10	10	The weight of systemic tragedy. 10.
Revised Base: (8×.20)+(10×.10)+(6×.10)+(7×.10)+(7×.15)+(10×.15)+(10×.10)+(10×.10) = 8.45 Final: 8.45 × 1.05 = 8.87

4. Better Call Saul (63 eps → ×1.05)
Current: 8.93

Category	Current	Reconsidered	Reasoning
Characters	9	9	Jimmy and Kim are all-time greats. Chuck, Mike, Nacho, Howard are very good. 9 is fair.
World-Building	7	7	Shares BB's world, adds legal layer. Good not exceptional. 7.
Cinematography	9.5	9	Masterful. But 9.5 is awkward and 10 is too high. 9.
Visual Spectacle	6	6	Courtrooms, offices, desert. 6.
Narrative Drive	9	9	Slow burn that earns every minute. Tension is unbearable. 9.
Thematic Resonance	9	8	Identity, self-deception, can people change. Strong but more intimate than BB's themes. 8.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	7	Tight focus. 7.
Gravitas	10	9	Chuck, Howard, Kim leaving—devastating. But slightly less crushing than BB's peaks? 9.
Revised Base: (9×.20)+(7×.10)+(9×.10)+(6×.10)+(9×.15)+(8×.15)+(7×.10)+(9×.10) = 8.25 Final: 8.25 × 1.05 = 8.66

5. The Sopranos (86 eps → ×1.05)
Current: 8.72

Category	Current	Reconsidered	Reasoning
Characters	9.5	9	Tony is the template. Carmela, Christopher, Paulie—deep bench. But 9.5 is awkward. 9 for consistency.
World-Building	8	8	North Jersey mob feels lived-in. 8.
Cinematography	6	6	TV of its era. 6.
Visual Spectacle	5	5	Suburban NJ, strip clubs. 5.
Narrative Drive	8	7	Some episodes meander. Dream sequences lose people. The patience is intentional but tests you. 7.
Thematic Resonance	10	10	Invented prestige TV themes. American dream rotting. 10.
Dimensionality/Scope	8	8	Mob, family, psychology, American culture. 8.
Gravitas	10	10	The weight is crushing. The finale still debated. 10.
Revised Base: (9×.20)+(8×.10)+(6×.10)+(5×.10)+(7×.15)+(10×.15)+(8×.10)+(10×.10) = 8.15 Final: 8.15 × 1.05 = 8.56

6. The Shield (88 eps → ×1.05)

Visual Spectacle	5	5	Police stations, streets. 5.
Narrative Drive	9	9	Relentless momentum. Lies compound. 9.
Thematic Resonance	9	8	Corruption, ends vs means. Strong but not life-changing. 8.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	7	Cops, gangs, politics. 7.
Gravitas	10	10	The finale is devastating. 10.
Revised Base: (9×.20)+(7×.10)+(6×.10)+(5×.10)+(9×.15)+(8×.15)+(7×.10)+(10×.10) = 7.85 Final: 7.85 × 1.05 = 8.24

So I'm noticing some inconsistencies with the character rating through this list a lot of shows are getting nines whereas Game of Thrones gets a nine that makes absolutely no sense so I think you either need to reduce some of these Nines down remembering that a nine is incredible 99% perfect and would require four plus characters like that perhaps Game of Thrones deserves a ten and the others need to be looked at as we go here like cinematoc like a world building and Rome 10 couldn't be better perfect really so yeah this a few things they need to be looked at I feel like some shows are a little too far down now like succession like way down at 52 seems a little rough same with House of the Dragon it has the dragon was like legit especially season 1 season 1 of the dragon was on par with like Peak game throwns just my perspective but it feels like 55 down with these others rough like they expands and battlestar Galactic and the same score maybe but that does seem pretty rough so yeah go over it again slowly and just say if you can rethink about a lot of these scores just remembering the scale properly not not giving things like Nines when maybe keeping sort of like a reference in your head of like what a nine would be right so with the characters if you're gonna give game Thrones and nine the show has to have as good characters perhaps you could do decimal points if the helps so like 8.5 8.3 if the helps do that

Recalibrated rating scale by establishing stricter character benchmarks and decimal precision






You're absolutely right. I've been handing out 9s too freely. Let me recalibrate properly.

The 9 Standard for Characters:

Game of Thrones S1-4 has: Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime, Tywin, Arya, Ned, Joffrey, The Hound, Littlefinger, Varys, Robert, Catelyn—that's 10+ deeply complex characters
If that's a 9, then very few shows should match it
World-Building 10 Standard:

GoT/Westeros and The Wire/Baltimore are the benchmarks
Rome is great but is it impossible to improve? Probably not.
Let me redo the full list with decimals for precision:

That looks much cleaner. Succession at #17, House of the Dragon at #14, both in credible positions. The top 10 is rock solid. How does this look?

Ok cool now can we save that or download there as a file and also just top 100 so skip anything under 100 oh man I'm hold on a second I'm surprised to and/or doesn't get into the top 100 that's crazy so there's yeah actually before you cut out the bottom anything over a hundred there's a few shows in here that I would say would definitely deserve a higher ranking for example and or Sherlock taboo made the handmade's tail surely right re look at those

Jan 5
Let me re-evaluate those:

Andor (12 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 7.72 (#102). This feels way too low.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7.5	8.5	Cassian's arc is excellent. Luthen is one of the best characters in years ("I burn my decency for someone else's future"). Dedra, Kino Loy, Maarva—all memorable.
World-Building	9	9	Best Star Wars has ever felt—lived in, gritty, real.
Cinematography	9	9	Cinematic. The prison arc is beautifully shot.
Visual Spectacle	8	8.5	Narkina 5, Ferrix, Aldhani heist. Impressive.
Narrative Drive	8	8.5	The prison arc is relentless. Some early Ferrix drag but builds beautifully.
Thematic Resonance	8.5	9	Rebellion, fascism, what it costs to fight. "I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them." Profound.
Dimensionality/Scope	7	7.5	Empire, rebellion, politics, personal—solid scope for 12 eps.
Gravitas	8	9	Maarva's speech. The finale. Kino's "I can't swim." Devastating.
Revised Base: 8.55 → Final: 8.12

Sherlock (15 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 6.87 (#105). S1-2 are excellent but S3-4 are messy.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7.5	8	Sherlock and Watson are iconic. Moriarty is fun. But shallow beyond the leads.
World-Building	8	7.5	Modern London. Fine but not distinctive.
Cinematography	8	8	Stylish, inventive visual storytelling.
Visual Spectacle	7	7	London, some nice set pieces. Not spectacular.
Narrative Drive	8	7.5	Great individual episodes, but later seasons lose the plot.
Thematic Resonance	6	6	It's not really about anything deep. Entertainment over meaning.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	6	Mystery of the week. Limited.
Gravitas	7	7	Reichenbach is effective. Otherwise light.
Revised Base: 7.13 → Final: 6.77

Actually I think Sherlock is about right where it is. It's entertaining but not prestige-tier.

Taboo (8 eps → ×0.90)
Currently at 6.87 (#106). One season, cancelled/unfinished.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7.5	8	Tom Hardy's Delaney is magnetic—strange, haunted, menacing. Supporting cast solid.
World-Building	9	9	Regency London's dark underbelly. Gritty, textured, immersive.
Cinematography	9	9	Beautiful and oppressive.
Visual Spectacle	7	7.5	Period London, ships, some striking imagery.
Narrative Drive	7	7	Slow burn that doesn't fully pay off (unfinished).
Thematic Resonance	7	7.5	Colonialism, empire, trauma. Present but underdeveloped.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	6.5	Revenge plot with political intrigue.
Gravitas	8	8	Weight to the atmosphere and Delaney's past.
Revised Base: 7.73 → Final: 6.96

Taboo is hurt badly by the 0.90 multiplier and being unfinished. It's a solid 7 show that can't get higher due to lack of completion.

Maid (10 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 6.82 (#110).

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7.5	8	Margaret Qualley is extraordinary. Her mother (Andie MacDowell) is heartbreaking. Alex feels deeply real.
World-Building	7	7.5	Working-class America, poverty, the system. Feels authentic.
Cinematography	7	7	Functional. Nothing distinctive.
Visual Spectacle	5	5	Apartments, cars, cleaning jobs. Deliberately unglamorous.
Narrative Drive	7	8	Gripping—you're desperate for her to escape.
Thematic Resonance	9	9	Poverty trap, invisible abuse, motherhood, systemic failure. Powerful.
Dimensionality/Scope	5	5	Focused on one woman's struggle.
Gravitas	8	8.5	Quietly devastating. The weight is real.
Revised Base: 7.43 → Final: 7.06

The Handmaid's Tale (56 eps → ×1.02)
Currently at 6.99 (#116). S1 is excellent, S2-5 are repetitive.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7	7	June has plot armor and makes same choices repeatedly. Serena is more interesting.
World-Building	8	8.5	Gilead is chilling and fully realized.
Cinematography	8	8.5	Beautiful—the reds, the compositions. Distinctive.
Visual Spectacle	7	7.5	Gilead's imagery is striking.
Narrative Drive	5	5	Spins wheels for seasons. Frustrating.
Thematic Resonance	7	7.5	Timely themes about bodily autonomy, fascism. But hammered repetitively.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	6.5	Gilead, Canada, resistance. Some scope.
Gravitas	7	7	Numbing misery. Diminishing returns.
Revised Base: 7.08 → Final: 7.22

REVISED SCORES
Show	Old Final	New Final
Andor	7.72	8.12
Sherlock	6.87	6.77 (stays low)
Taboo	6.87	6.96
Maid	6.82	7.06
The Handmaid's Tale	6.99	7.22
Andor now jumps into the top 15 where it belongs. The others get minor adjustments but stay roughly where they were. Want me to compile the final top 100 now?

ah one sec ill look for any more that look out of place Mind Hunter rectify adolescence severance lost the good seasons silo dark plurribus Babylon Berlin shogun the expands the neck Boardwalk Empire let's have a look at all those

Jan 5
Let me re-evaluate each of these:

Mindhunter (19 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 7.06 (#87). Fincher-produced, cancelled after S2.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7.5	8	Holden's descent into the abyss is fascinating. Tench is wonderful—the weight of his home life. Wendy is underseen great character. Ed Kemper scenes are extraordinary.
World-Building	8	8.5	FBI in the 70s, birth of criminal profiling. Textured and authentic.
Cinematography	9	9.5	Fincher's fingerprints everywhere. Meticulous, controlled, oppressive. Among TV's best.
Visual Spectacle	5	5	Offices, prisons, interview rooms. Deliberately mundane.
Narrative Drive	7	7	Slow. The interviews are gripping but plot meanders. BTK tease never paid off.
Thematic Resonance	8	8.5	What does it cost to understand evil? Holden losing himself. Staring into the abyss.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	6	Focused on one unit, one mission.
Gravitas	8	8	The interviews have weight. Atlanta child murders arc is heavy.
Revised Base: 7.65 → Final: 7.27

Rectify (30 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 7.20 (#78). Underseen masterpiece.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	8.5	9	Daniel Holden is one of TV's most extraordinary creations. Aden Young's performance is transcendent—the stillness, the damage, the humanity. Amantha, Teddy, Tawney—all feel achingly real.
World-Building	7	7.5	Small-town Georgia. Intimate, specific, authentic.
Cinematography	8	8.5	Meditative, gorgeous. Southern light used beautifully. Patient framing.
Visual Spectacle	5	5	Small town. Not its concern.
Narrative Drive	6	6	Glacially slow. It's a meditation, not a thriller. Will lose many viewers.
Thematic Resonance	10	10	What prison does to a soul. Time, guilt, redemption, re-entering life. Unique and profound. Nothing else like it.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	6	One man's reintegration. Laser-focused.
Gravitas	9	9.5	Quiet devastation. The weight of twenty lost years. Deeply affecting.
Revised Base: 7.83 → Final: 7.44

Adolescence (4 eps → ×0.90)
Currently at 7.25 (#76). Single-take episodes, massive cultural impact.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	8	8	Jamie, his parents, the detective—all feel real. Stephen Graham is remarkable. Limited character count but depth in four hours.
World-Building	7	7	English town, modern Britain. Authentic but not expansive.
Cinematography	9	9.5	Single-take episodes are a technical marvel. Not gimmicky—it creates unbearable tension and intimacy.
Visual Spectacle	5	5	Houses, schools, police stations. Not spectacular.
Narrative Drive	9	9.5	Four hours of relentless tension. You cannot look away. Real-time amplifies everything.
Thematic Resonance	9	9.5	Incel culture, social media, masculinity, parenting, guilt. Timely and devastating.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	6	One crime, one family. Focused.
Gravitas	10	10	Crushing. Episode 3 is unbearable in the best way. The finale leaves you hollow.
Revised Base: 8.35 → Final: 7.52

Severance (19 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 7.34 (#75). S2 was massive.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7	7.5	Mark, Helly, Irving, Dylan—growing into fascinating people. Miss Huang. Still developing but S2 deepened everyone significantly.
World-Building	9	9.5	Lumon is one of TV's great creations. The MDR floor, the break room, the mythology. Deeply unsettling and fully realized.
Cinematography	8	8.5	Sterile, precise, Kubrickian. The compositions are deliberate and beautiful.
Visual Spectacle	6	6.5	Offices and corridors—but they're distinctive offices and corridors. The design is striking.
Narrative Drive	9	9	Compulsive mystery. S1 and S2 finales are heart-stopping.
Thematic Resonance	8.5	9	Work-life separation, identity, corporate dystopia, what we owe ourselves. Increasingly profound.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	6.5	Focused on Lumon but expanding.
Gravitas	8	8.5	The finales hit hard. "She's alive" moment. Growing weight.
Revised Base: 8.08 → Final: 7.68

Lost (121 eps → ×1.05)
Currently at 7.35 (#73). Judging S1-3 primarily.

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7.5	8	Jack, Locke, Sawyer, Kate, Hurley, Ben, Desmond—large memorable ensemble. The flashbacks give unusual depth. Some weaker characters but strong core.
World-Building	7	8	The island is genuinely mysterious. DHARMA, the Others, the mythology—it's compelling even if it doesn't fully cohere.
Cinematography	7	7	Good for network TV. Nothing exceptional.
Visual Spectacle	7	7.5	The island, the hatch, the plane crash. More ambitious than most network.
Narrative Drive	7	8	S1-3 are incredibly propulsive. Mystery boxes work brilliantly... until they don't.
Thematic Resonance	6.5	7	Faith vs science, redemption, connection. Present but muddled by mythology confusion.
Dimensionality/Scope	7.5	8	Multiple timelines, large cast, sci-fi, drama, mystery. Ambitious scope.
Gravitas	6.5	7	"Not Penny's Boat." Charlie's death. Some genuinely heavy moments amid the confusion.
Revised Base: 7.53 → Final: 7.91

Silo (20 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 7.32 (#69).

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7	7.5	Juliette is compelling. Rebecca Ferguson carries it. Supporting cast is growing.
World-Building	9	9.5	The silo is extraordinary. 144 levels, the rules, the history, the mystery. Fully immersive.
Cinematography	8	8	Good use of the confined space. Claustrophobic when needed.
Visual Spectacle	7	8	The silo itself is visually impressive. The outside shots. Production design is excellent.
Narrative Drive	8	8.5	Mystery propels it forward. S2 expands beautifully. Compulsive viewing.
Thematic Resonance	8	8	Truth, control, rebellion, what we're told vs what's real. Solid.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	7	Expanding beyond the silo now. Growing scope.
Gravitas	8	8	Deaths matter. The revelations land.
Revised Base: 8.00 → Final: 7.60

Dark (26 eps → ×0.95)
Currently at 7.39 (#68).

Category	Old	New	Reason
Characters	7	7	The time-jumping makes it hard to invest. You're tracking versions more than people. Impressive puzzle but emotionally distant.
World-Building	9	9.5	The time loops, the family trees, the cave, the apocalypse—meticulously constructed. Rewatchable for details.
Cinematography	8	8.5	Moody, atmospheric, consistent visual language. Rain-soaked and oppressive.
Visual Spectacle	6	6.5	German town, caves, power plant. Not spectacular but eerie.
Narrative Drive	8	8.5	The puzzle is compulsive. You need to understand.
Thematic Resonance	8.5	9	Fate, free will, family, cycles of pain. Genuinely philosophical. Sticks with you.
Dimensionality/Scope	8	8	Three timelines, multiple families, sci-fi, drama. Ambitious.

That's significant movement. The Expanse, Shogun, Babylon Berlin, and Boardwalk Empire all jump into much stronger positions. Want me to compile the final top 100 now?

Yeah but the world building I think that everything should just take Game of Thrones as a reference because if Game of Thrones is a tin on world building some of these other shows should not be getting as close like a 9.5 would be goddamn pretty damn close to Westeros maybe some things can do that like other other worlds that as good as West rosters definitely a thing but have a look at that so yeah #redo the whole order and #redo all of the world building scores

Jan 5
You're right. Let me recalibrate world-building with Game of Thrones (10) as the benchmark.

The 10 Standard (Westeros):

Thousands of years of history
Multiple religions fully realized
Distinct cultures across continents
Political systems, economies, languages
You could write encyclopedias about it
9 = Exceptional but not Westeros-level:

The Wire's Baltimore (institutions fully mapped)
Maybe 1-2 others
8 = Very strong world-building 7 = Good, believable world 6 = Functional backdrop 5 = Generic/minimal

I don't see any euphoria in there that was real good and also the girls or just girls

Jan 5
Good catches. Let me score both:

Euphoria (17 eps → ×0.95)
Category	Score	Reason
Characters	8	Rue is extraordinary—Zendaya's performance is phenomenal. Cassie, Maddy, Jules, Fez all have depth. Some characters are thinner (Kat sidelined).
World-Building	7	American high school but heightened. The party scene, the drugs. Stylized not realistic.
Cinematography	9.5	Stunning. The lighting, the color, the camera movement. Sam Levinson's visual style is distinctive and beautiful. Among TV's best-looking shows.
Visual Spectacle	8.5	The party scenes, the makeup, the staging. Visually arresting throughout.
Narrative Drive	7	S1 is propulsive. S2 meanders and has pacing issues. Uneven.
Thematic Resonance	8.5	Addiction, identity, trauma, teenage chaos, the performance of self. Hits hard.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	High school drama. Focused on one group.
Gravitas	8.5	Rue's spiral is devastating. Real weight to the consequences. S1 finale, S2 intervention episode.
Base: 8.00 → Final: 7.60

Girls (62 eps → ×1.05)
Category	Score	Reason
Characters	8.5	Hannah, Marnie, Jessa, Shoshanna—all flawed, all fascinating, all infuriating in specific ways. Adam is extraordinary. Lena Dunham wrote young women with brutal honesty.
World-Building	7	Brooklyn millennial world. Authentic to its moment. Specific but not expansive.
Cinematography	7	Naturalistic, handheld. Serves the intimacy. Nothing flashy.
Visual Spectacle	5	Apartments, coffee shops, Brooklyn streets. Deliberately unglamorous.
Narrative Drive	7	Meandering by design. Slice of life. Some seasons drag, others are tight.
Thematic Resonance	8.5	Entitlement, friendship, growing up, failure to launch, the gap between who we think we are and who we are. Painfully true.
Dimensionality/Scope	6	Four friends in Brooklyn. Narrow focus.
Gravitas	7.5	Quieter weight. Hannah's breakdown episodes hit. The Adam/Jessa betrayal. The finale works.
Base: 7.30 → Final: 7.67

Updated Positions
Show	Final	Approximate Rank
Girls	7.67	~32
Euphoria	7.60	~38
Both slot into the upper-middle of the list—strong shows that don't quite crack the elite tier but are memorable and well-crafted.

Want me to add these and regenerate the full top 100 file?

I'm pretty sure you doing the math wrong

Jan 5
You're right, let me recalculate:

Euphoria (17 eps → ×0.95)
Category	Weight	Score	Weighted
Characters	20%	8	1.60
World-Building	10%	7	0.70
Cinematography	10%	9.5	0.95
Visual Spectacle	10%	8.5	0.85
Narrative Drive	15%	7	1.05
Thematic Resonance	15%	8.5	1.275
Dimensionality/Scope	10%	6	0.60
Gravitas	10%	8.5	0.85
Base: 7.925 × 0.95 = 7.53

Girls (62 eps → ×1.05)
Category	Weight	Score	Weighted
Characters	20%	8.5	1.70
World-Building	10%	7	0.70
Cinematography	10%	7	0.70

Dimensionality/Scope	10%	6	0.60
Gravitas	10%	7.5	0.75
Base: 7.275 × 1.05 = 7.64

Better?

It's because of the episode multiplier yeah the epidode multiplies a little rough, this is a good example yeah let's do a list of a multiplier for extra episodes

Jan 5
Yeah the current multiplier bands are too crude. Let me propose a more granular system:

Revised Episode Multiplier
Episodes	Multiplier	Reasoning
1-5	×0.85	Very short—easy to be perfect
6-9	×0.90	Miniseries
10-15	×0.93	Short season
16-20	×0.95	1-2 seasons
21-30	×0.97	2-3 seasons
31-40	×1.00	Baseline
41-50	×1.02	Solid run
51-60	×1.03	Long run
61-75	×1.04	Very long
76-100	×1.05	Exceptional length
100+	×1.06	Marathon
This way:

Euphoria (17 eps) gets ×0.95 instead of ×0.95 (same)
Girls (62 eps) gets ×1.04 instead of ×1.05
Chernobyl (5 eps) gets ×0.85 instead of ×0.90
True Detective S1 (8 eps) gets ×0.90 (same)
Game of Thrones S1-4 (40 eps) gets ×1.00 (same)
Does this feel more fair? Or do you want to tweak the bands/numbers?

Um I think the many series should just be at one baseline because mini series is supposed to be that long it has its conclusion and a generally isn't too short or too long

Jan 5
Good point. A miniseries is designed to be that length—it's not "easier" to make a great 5-episode miniseries, it's just a different format. Chernobyl being 5 episodes is intentional and complete.

Revised Episode Multiplier
Episodes	Multiplier	Reasoning
Miniseries (any length)	×1.00	Complete story as intended
10-20	×0.95	1-2 seasons, still proving itself
21-30	×0.97	2-3 seasons
31-40	×1.00	Baseline
41-50	×1.02	Solid run
51-60	×1.03	Long run
61-75	×1.04	Very long
76-100	×1.05	Exceptional length
100+	×1.06	Marathon
So now:

Chernobyl (5 eps, miniseries) → ×1.00
Band of Brothers (10 eps, miniseries) → ×1.00
True Detective S1 (8 eps, miniseries) → ×1.00
Adolescence (4 eps, miniseries) → ×1.00
Euphoria (17 eps, ongoing) → ×0.95
Girls (62 eps) → ×1.04
Does that work better?

ok sure Now can you have a look over before you print the 100 again you just go over and you see if you've seen any outliers things that are in the obviously the wrong place and re-evaluate

Jan 5
Let me think through the major shifts this new multiplier system will cause and flag any outliers:

Big Winners (Miniseries now at ×1.00)
Show	Old Mult	New Mult	Old Final	New Final
Chernobyl	0.90	1.00	7.92	8.80
Band of Brothers	0.95	1.00	7.77	8.18
True Detective S1	0.90	1.00	7.63	8.48
Adolescence	0.90	1.00	7.45	8.28
Angels in America	0.90	1.00	7.41	8.23
When They See Us	0.90	1.00	7.20	8.00
It's a Sin	0.90	1.00	7.34	8.15
Generation Kill	0.90	1.00	7.00	7.78
Wolf Hall	0.90	1.00	7.16	7.95
Potential Outliers to Check
Chernobyl at 8.80 (#3-4 range)

Is it really on par with Breaking Bad/The Wire?
It's extraordinary but 5 hours vs 60+ hours of sustained excellence
Maybe the base score of 8.80 is too high? Let me recheck:
Characters: 8 (limited time, well-drawn but not deep ensemble)
World: 8
Cine: 9
Spectacle: 9
Narrative: 10 (perfect tension)
Theme: 10 (devastating)
Scope: 6 (one event)
Gravitas: 10
Base = (8×.20)+(8×.10)+(9×.10)+(9×.10)+(10×.15)+(10×.15)+(6×.10)+(10×.10) = 8.80

That's correct. But should a 5-hour miniseries really sit at #3? It's perfect for what it is, but is it an all-time great TV show? I'd argue yes—it's a complete masterpiece.

True Detective S1 at 8.48 (#5-6 range)

8 perfect hours. McConaughey's best work. Fukunaga's direction.
But above The Sopranos? That feels wrong.
The base might be slightly high. Let me recheck:
Characters: 8.5 (two great characters, not an ensemble)
World: 7.5
Cine: 10
Spectacle: 8
Narrative: 9
Theme: 9
Scope: 6
Gravitas: 9
Base = (8.5×.20)+(7.5×.10)+(10×.10)+(8×.10)+(9×.15)+(9×.15)+(6×.10)+(9×.10) = 8.45

Close. Maybe Characters should be 8 (only two characters with real depth)? That would give 8.35.

Adolescence at 8.28 (#8-10 range)

4 episodes, massive impact
Technically brilliant (single takes)
But top 10 all time? Above Mad Men, Six Feet Under?
Let me recheck the base:
Characters: 8 (limited cast, well-drawn)
World: 6.5
Cine: 9.5
Spectacle: 5
Narrative: 9.5
Theme: 9.5
Scope: 6
Gravitas: 10
Base = (8×.20)+(6.5×.10)+(9.5×.10)+(5×.10)+(9.5×.15)+(9.5×.15)+(6×.10)+(10×.10) = 8.25

That's high. Maybe Theme at 9 instead of 9.5? And Narrative at 9? That gives 8.10.

Shows That Might Be Too Low

The Sopranos at 8.48

The template for prestige TV
Should it be below True Detective S1? No.
Let me recheck: Base was 8.08 × 1.05 = 8.48
That actually seems right given the recalibrated scores.
Succession at 7.80

Dropped quite far
But 39 episodes at ×1.00 baseline
Maybe Characters should be 9? The Roy family is one of TV's great ensembles.
Let me reconsider: Kendall, Logan, Shiv, Roman, Tom, Greg, Connor—all distinct, all fascinating
Revised Characters: 8.5 → 9?
If Characters = 9: Base = (9×.20)+(7×.10)+(8×.10)+(7×.10)+(8.5×.15)+(8×.15)+(6.5×.10)+(8.5×.10) = 8.00 Final = 8.00 × 1.00 = 8.00

That feels better.

Proposed Adjustments
Show	Category	Old	New	Reason
True Detective S1	Characters	8.5	8	Only two deep characters
Adolescence	Theme	9.5	9	Powerful but not life-changing like The Wire
Adolescence	Narrative	9.5	9	Tight but very short
Succession	Characters	8.5	9	The Roys are an all-time ensemble
Chernobyl	Keep as is	-	-	It's genuinely that good
Other Potential Issues
The Expanse at 8.43 (#6)

Above The Sopranos? That feels wrong.
Characters at 7.5 is fair—some are bland
Maybe World at 9 is too high? It's great sci-fi worldbuilding but is it Wire-level?
Revised World: 9 → 8.5
New base = (7.5×.20)+(8.5×.10)+(7×.10)+(8.5×.10)+(7.5×.15)+(8×.15)+(9×.10)+(8×.10) = 7.88 Final = 7.88 × 1.04 = 8.20

That's more reasonable.

Boardwalk Empire at 8.16 (#10)

Above Mad Men and Six Feet Under?
It's good but not that good
Characters at 8 might be generous—Nucky isn't quite elite tier
Revised Characters: 8 → 7.5
New base = (7.5×.20)+(8.5×.10)+(8.5×.10)+(8.5×.10)+(7×.15)+(7.5×.15)+(8.5×.10)+(8×.10) = 7.88 Final = 7.88 × 1.03 = 8.12

Still high but more reasonable.

Revised Top 15 Preview
Rank	Show	Final
1	Game of Thrones (S1-4)	~9.33
2	Breaking Bad	~8.98
3	The Wire	~8.96
4	Chernobyl	~8.80
5	Better Call Saul	~8.59

12	Angels in America	~8.23
13	Deadwood	~8.08
14	It's a Sin	~8.15
15	Band of Brothers	~8.18
Does this look more reasonable? The miniseries are now properly rewarded but I've tightened some scores to prevent them from completely dominating the top 10.

So yeah I think you're right about pretty much everything the problem with bringing the family above up to a nine is that that's equal to Game of Thrones so I guess you have to increase the Game of Thrones characters to 10 I mean it's perfect let's be real yes there are some characters aren't as good but it has like at least six perfect characters so get Game of Thrones should probably be a ten, yeah The Sopranos will be too low now maybe change the multiplier for many series to slightly less than one to just pull it down a little bit so that it doesn't get above the old-time greats yeah and with little boardwalk I think it's criminally underrated

Jan 5
You're right on all counts. Let me adjust:

Changes
Game of Thrones Characters: 9.5 → 10

Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime, Tywin, Arya, Ned, The Hound, Littlefinger, Varys, Joffrey—at least 6-8 perfect characters
The deepest ensemble in TV history
10 is earned
Miniseries Multiplier: 1.00 → 0.98

Acknowledges they're complete works but prevents them leapfrogging 60+ hour masterpieces
Chernobyl is perfect but shouldn't sit above The Sopranos
Succession Characters: 8.5 → 9

The Roys are an all-time ensemble
Not GoT-level (10) but exceptional
Boardwalk Empire

You think it's underrated—what would you adjust? Characters higher? I had it at 7.5.

Game of Thrones S1-4 (40 eps → ×1.00) Base = (10×.20)+(10×.10)+(8×.10)+(9.5×.10)+(10×.15)+(8×.10)+(10×.10)+(10×.10) = 9.45 Final = 9.45

Chernobyl (miniseries → ×0.98) Base = 8.80 × 0.98 = 8.62

True Detective S1 (miniseries → ×0.98) Base = 8.35 × 0.98 = 8.18

The Sopranos (86 eps → ×1.05) Base = 8.08 × 1.05 = 8.48

Succession (39 eps → ×1.00) Base = (9×.20)+(7×.10)+(8×.10)+(7×.10)+(8.5×.15)+(8×.15)+(6.5×.10)+(8.5×.10) = 8.00 Final = 8.00

Now Chernobyl (8.62) sits below Better Call Saul (8.59)... wait that's still above. Let me check BCS:

Better Call Saul (63 eps → ×1.04) Base = 8.18 × 1.04 = 8.51

So the order would be:

Game of Thrones S1-4 — 9.45
Breaking Bad — 8.98
The Wire — 8.96
Chernobyl — 8.62
Better Call Saul — 8.51
The Sopranos — 8.48
Chernobyl above BCS and Sopranos still feels a bit off. Should we drop miniseries to ×0.96?

yeah

shogun is overrated there

Jan 5
You're right. Let me reconsider Shogun:

Shogun (2024) - Reassessment
Category	Current	Revised	Reason
Characters	8.5	8	Toranaga is great, Mariko is excellent. But Blackthorne is a bit bland. Not a deep ensemble beyond those two.
World-Building	9	9	Feudal Japan is stunning. This holds.
Cinematography	9.5	9	Beautiful but not revolutionary.
Visual Spectacle	9.5	9	Gorgeous but not GoT-level scale.
Narrative Drive	8	7.5	Political intrigue is slow at times. Some drag in the middle.
Thematic Resonance	8	7	Duty, honor, cultural clash—solid but not profound.
Dimensionality/Scope	7.5	7	One conflict, one period. Focused.
Gravitas	9	8	Mariko's death lands. Rest is less impactful.
Revised Base: (8×.20)+(9×.10)+(9×.10)+(9×.10)+(7.5×.15)+(7×.15)+(7×.10)+(8×.10) = 7.87

Final: 7.87 × 0.95 = 7.48

That drops it from ~8.15 to 7.48, which puts it around #40-50 range. More appropriate for a very good show that hasn't proven itself over multiple seasons yet.

Does that feel better?

yeah go ahead and print 100

Top 100 tv rankings final
Document · MD 
Characters & Acting
Characters & Acting evaluates whether the people on screen feel like real individuals making authentic, internally consistent choices. It assesses depth of characterization, psychological believability, meaningful change over time, and the strength of the ensemble as a whole—not just standout leads. Acting is judged on embodiment and invisibility: performances should disappear into the role rather than draw attention to themselves. High scores reflect characters who feel autonomous, linger in the viewer’s mind, and remain compelling beyond the immediate plot.
World Building
World Building measures how fully realized and self-sustaining the show’s world feels. This includes consistency of rules, institutions, cultures, and social structures, as well as the sense that life exists beyond the immediate story being told. A strong world feels navigable and durable: the viewer can understand how power works, how people live, and what pressures shape behavior without constant exposition. High scores are reserved for worlds that feel lived-in, coherent, and capable of supporting many stories.
Cinematography
Cinematography evaluates the visual craft and intentionality behind how the story is told. This includes framing, camera movement, lighting, color, composition, and visual rhythm, with emphasis on coherence and meaning rather than surface beauty. High-scoring shows demonstrate a distinctive and consistent visual language, where the camera communicates narrative or character information rather than merely recording events. A key marker is recognizability: the ability to identify the show from a single frame.
Visual Spectacle
Visual Spectacle measures the impact, ambition, and sustained presence of what is shown on screen. This includes large-scale environments, meticulously crafted sets, production design, visual effects, and striking or immersive imagery. Frequency matters when spectacle is genuinely sustained across scenes and episodes. Spectacle may also arise from novelty and exposure—revealing places, systems, or ways of life the viewer has rarely or never seen, captured with authority and detail. The focus is on how visually compelling and memorable the on-screen world is, whether through epic construction or grounded realism.
Conceptual Density
Conceptual Density measures how many distinct ideas a series meaningfully engages with, and how well those ideas are integrated into the narrative. These concepts may be political, philosophical, social, moral, or institutional, but must be dramatized through story, character, and world rather than stated directly. Higher scores reflect shows that sustain multiple independent concepts across episodes and seasons, explore them from different angles, and allow them to interact or conflict. The emphasis is on breadth of ideas combined with coherent execution, not symbolic interpretation or tone.
Narrative Drive
Narrative Drive assesses how effectively the story pulls the viewer forward. This includes pacing, clarity of stakes, escalation, and whether each episode meaningfully advances the narrative. A strong sense of drive does not require constant action; slower or quieter series can score highly if momentum, tension, or curiosity are consistently maintained. Filler, stalling, or structural wheel-spinning lowers the score. The core question is whether the story moves with purpose.
Narrative Path & Resolution
Narrative Path & Resolution evaluates how effectively a series fulfills the narrative promises it introduces. This includes how many story loops, mysteries, arcs, or tensions are opened, how deliberately they are carried forward, and how meaningfully they are resolved. High scores reflect disciplined loop management, strong closure rates, and payoffs that feel earned—often enhancing or recontextualizing earlier material. Ambiguity is not penalized when intentional and coherent, but unresolved, rushed, or undermining resolutions reduce the score. This category rewards narrative discipline over novelty.  

this is my new categorys for ranking

Show more
Jan 6
These are much better categories - more precise and less overlapping. Let me compare:

OLD vs NEW
Old	New	Notes
Characters & Acting (20%)	Characters & Acting	Refined but similar
World-Building (10%)	World Building	Same
Cinematography (10%)	Cinematography	Same, better defined
Visual Spectacle (10%)	Visual Spectacle	Expanded to include "novelty/exposure"
Thematic Resonance (15%)	Conceptual Density	Big change - now about breadth of ideas, not emotional resonance
Narrative Drive (15%)	Narrative Drive	Same
Dimensionality/Scope (10%)	Removed	Absorbed into Conceptual Density
Gravitas/Weight (10%)	Removed	-
-	Narrative Path & Resolution	NEW - loop closure, payoffs
Questions:
Weights? What percentages for each of the 7 categories?
Gravitas gone - Are you okay losing "sit in silence after the episode" as a metric? Or is that now folded into Characters/Narrative Resolution?
Conceptual Density vs old Thematic Resonance - This is a big shift. Old system rewarded emotional/philosophical depth. New system rewards breadth of ideas. Shows like The Leftovers (narrow but profound) might drop, while The Wire (many institutional ideas) might rise. Is that intended?
Episode multiplier - Keep the same system?
Let me know the weights and I can recalculate the whole list with the new framework.

you decide

Jan 6
Okay, here's my proposal:

NEW CATEGORY WEIGHTS
Category	Weight	Reasoning
Characters & Acting	20%	Still the most important - characters are why we care
World Building	10%	Important foundation but not primary
Cinematography	10%	Craft matters but shouldn't dominate
Visual Spectacle	10%	Same
Conceptual Density	15%	Replaces Thematic Resonance + absorbs some Dimensionality
Narrative Drive	15%	Keeps people watching
Narrative Path & Resolution	20%	NEW and deserves high weight - this is what separates great shows from good ones. Did they stick the landing? Did they earn their mysteries?
Total: 100%

RATIONALE FOR RESOLUTION AT 20%
This is the category that punishes:

Lost (mystery boxes without payoff)
The Handmaid's Tale (spinning wheels)
Shows that collapse in final seasons
And rewards:

Breaking Bad (perfect closure)
The Americans (devastating finale)
Better Call Saul (every thread tied)
The Shield (all chickens come home)
This feels right - a show that doesn't resolve well shouldn't rank alongside one that does.

GRAVITAS
I think Gravitas gets folded into:

Characters (we feel weight because we care about people)
Resolution (payoffs create the "sit in silence" feeling)

Lost drops to #27 (resolution score of 5 punishes it hard)
Mindhunter drops to #77 (cancelled, resolution 5)
Deadwood at #20 (cancelled hurts it)
The Knick at #28 (cancelled)
Yellowjackets drops to #99 (spinning wheels, resolution 5)
The Handmaid's Tale at #76 (drive 5, resolution 5)
The new Resolution category really separates:

Shows that stuck the landing (Breaking Bad, BCS, The Americans, The Shield, Six Feet Under, It's a Sin)
From shows that collapsed or were cancelled (Lost, Deadwood, The Knick, Mindhunter, Yellowjackets)

Category Definitions
Characters & Acting: Whether people on screen feel like real individuals making authentic, internally consistent choices. Depth of characterization, psychological believability, meaningful change over time, ensemble strength. Acting judged on embodiment—performances should disappear into the role.

World Building: How fully realized and self-sustaining the show's world feels. Consistency of rules, institutions, cultures. Sense that life exists beyond the immediate story. Benchmark: Game of Thrones/Westeros = 10.

Cinematography: Visual craft and intentionality. Framing, camera movement, lighting, color, composition. Emphasis on coherence and meaning. Key marker: recognizability from a single frame.

Visual Spectacle: Impact, ambition, and sustained presence of what is shown. Large-scale environments, production design, visual effects. Also novelty—revealing places or ways of life rarely seen.

Conceptual Density: How many distinct ideas the series meaningfully engages with. Political, philosophical, social, moral concepts dramatized through story. Breadth of ideas combined with coherent execution.

Narrative Drive: How effectively the story pulls the viewer forward. Pacing, clarity of stakes, escalation. Whether each episode meaningfully advances the narrative. Does the story move with purpose?

Narrative Path & Resolution: How effectively a series fulfills its narrative promises. Loop management, closure rates, earned payoffs. Rewards narrative discipline. Unresolved, rushed, or undermining resolutions lower the score.
