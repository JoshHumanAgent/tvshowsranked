## What It Feels Like to Watch

Andor isn't like other Star Wars stories. It's not about Jedi or lightsabers or the Force. It's about rebellion—the boring, difficult, unglamorous work of taking down an empire.

You meet Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) five years before Rogue One. He's a thief, a loner, someone who's given up on hope. But circumstances conspire to drag him into the fight against the Empire, and you watch as cynicism transforms into purpose.

The first three episodes work as a standalone film—Cassian's origin story, showing his world on the corporate-controlled planet Morlana One. It's gritty, realistic, and grounded. Then the show expands, introducing the rebel network, the Imperial occupation, and the small victories and terrible losses that define resistance.

Diego Luna is phenomenal. He makes Cassian's journey feel earned. You see his anger, his grief, his gradual opening to hope. The supporting cast is equally strong—particularly Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma and Stellan Skarsgård as Luthen Rael.

What makes Andor special is its willingness to take risks. It explores the moral complexity of rebellion. It shows the Empire not as cartoon villains but as a system that normal people participate in, often without thinking. It asks hard questions about what we're willing to sacrifice for freedom.

The production is gorgeous. The showrunner Tony Gilroy brings his Michael Clayton sensibilities to a galaxy far, far away. Every frame is composed. Every scene has purpose.

Andor is proof that Star Wars can tell mature stories. It's the anti-prequel—instead of explaining origins, it looks forward to consequences. We know how this story ends. But watching Cassian find his way there is unforgettable.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.50**

Scoring 8.5, Diego Luna provides soulful gravitas as Cassian Andor—a man becoming radical rather than born heroic. Genevieve O'Reilly's Mon Mothma is revelatory: a bureaucrat secretly funding rebellion, her every conversation layered with subtext. Stellan Skarsgård as Luthen delivers the show's best performance—a spymaster who sacrifices everything, including his own soul.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

Scoring 9, Rogue One's galaxy is expanded through lived-in detail: corporate security, prison labor, bureaucratic oppression, revolutionary cells. The show builds systemic evil through mundane cruelty—checks signed, orders processed, lives destroyed by paperwork. It's the most mature political world-building in Star Wars.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

Scoring 8.5, the visual approach is deliberately un-romantic—harsh lighting, industrial spaces, naturalistic camera work. The show rejects space-opera gloss for something closer to documentary realism. Every location feels physically present rather than digitally constructed.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 0.85**

Scoring 8, spectacle arrives through scale and implication rather than CGI excess. The prison break sequence is genuinely thrilling. The show understands that one well-staged explosion carries more weight than constant destruction. The practical locations provide authentic texture.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

Scoring 8.5, Andor interrogates what rebellion costs—morally, physically, politically. It asks whether the ends justify means when both sides employ violence. The density is in the questions: What does it mean to be radicalized? What's the price of resistance? Who gets sacrificed in the name of freedom?

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.13**

Scoring 8, the pacing is measured, building toward explosive set pieces. The heist episode and prison arc provide propulsive momentum when needed. The show trusts viewers to follow without hand-holding. Each season accelerates as consequences accumulate.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 1.20**

Scoring 6, Andor leads directly into Rogue One, so resolution is predetermined. The show's power comes from knowing Cassian's fate while watching his choices. The journey matters more than the destination—we know where he ends up. The lack of surprise is offset by emotional weight.
