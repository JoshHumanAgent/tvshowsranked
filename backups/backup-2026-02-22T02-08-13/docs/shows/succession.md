## What It Feels Like to Watch

Succession is a show about terrible people with obscene amounts of money, and you'll love watching them destroy each other.

At the center is Logan Roy (Brian Cox), the aging patriarch of a global media empire. He's dying—he knows it, his children know it, everyone knows it. And in the vacuum created by his decline, his four children—Kendall, Siobhan, Roman, and Connor—circle like sharks, each convinced they're the one who should inherit the throne.

The genius of Succession is how it makes you care about people you shouldn't. They're cruel, entitled, and out of touch. But underneath the arrogance, you see the wounds Logan inflicted. You see the desperate need for parental approval that will never come. You see people trying to fill a void that can never be filled.

Brian Cox is extraordinary as Logan—a monster who occasionally shows vulnerability, a father who destroys his children while claiming to love them. Jeremy Strong as Kendall is the heart of the series, a man desperately trying to prove himself while visibly drowning. Kieran Culkin as Roman is the jester who hides pain with jokes. Sarah Snook as Shiv is the strategist who thinks she's playing chess while everyone else plays poker.

The writing is razor-sharp. Every scene crackles with tension. Every episode ends with a reversal. The dialogue is quotable—everyone has a favorite line, a favorite insult, a favorite moment of pure cruelty.

But what elevates Succession beyond mere satire is its emotional core. Beneath the comedy and the backstabbing is a genuine exploration of family dysfunction, of what wealth does to people, of the hollowness at the center of power. The final season is devastating—not because of what happens, but because of what it means.

## 7-Dimension Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Characters & Acting (20%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.80**

Scoring 9, the ensemble operates at the highest level of television acting. Brian Cox's Logan Roy is a force of nature—terrifying, vulnerable, magnetic. Jeremy Strong's Kendall is a masterclass in internalized desperation; Kieran Culkin's Roman weaponizes charm to mask damage; Sarah Snook's Shiv weaponizes competence to mask insecurity. The supporting cast—Matthew Macfadyen, Nicholas Braun, J. Smith-Cameron—creates the most toxic corporate culture ever filmed. These performances are calibrated to millimeters.

### 2. World Building (15%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 1.05**

At 7, the world of Waystar RoyCo is convincing but narrow—private jets, penthouses, conference rooms. The show builds its environment through details: the corporate hierarchy, the family dysfunction, the obscene wealth contrasted with corporate precarity. The New York and international locations provide appropriate scale. The world serves the satire without becoming the point.

### 3. Cinematography (10%) — Score: 8

**Raw Score: 8 | Weighted: 0.80**

Scoring 8, the handheld, vérité style serves the material perfectly—intimate, slightly nauseating, never letting the audience settle. The color palette is muted, corporate, soul-dead. The framing emphasizes hierarchy: who's standing, who's sitting, who's in shadow. The show's visual language is consistent and purposeful, creating visual anxiety that matches the narrative.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 7

**Raw Score: 7 | Weighted: 0.70**

With 7, spectacle arrives through wealth display rather than action—yachts, helicopters, corporate retreats. These function as character moments rather than visual set pieces. The show's power comes from faces in close-up, not scale. The most visually striking sequences are often the quietest: Logan alone in his apartment, Kendall floating in a pool.

### 5. Conceptual Density (15%) — Score: 7.5

**Raw Score: 7.5 | Weighted: 1.13**

Scoring 7.5, Succession explores wealth, power, family trauma, and capitalism's moral bankruptcy. The density is in character psychology rather than overt thematics. Questions of legitimacy, legacy, and the cost of ambition animate every scene. The writing layers meaning through dialogue that operates on multiple registers—what's said, what's implied, what everyone knows but no one mentions.

### 6. Narrative Drive (15%) — Score: 8.5

**Raw Score: 8.5 | Weighted: 1.27**

At 8.5, each season accelerates toward its breaking point with inexorable momentum. The succession question drives the narrative while refusing resolution. Episode construction is masterful—scene after scene of escalating tension, punctuated by disasters. The show understands that power struggles are most compelling when they're intimate.

### 7. Narrative Resolution (15%) — Score: 9

**Raw Score: 9 | Weighted: 1.35**

Scoring 9, the series finale "With Open Eyes" provides catharsis without comfort. Logan's death is handled early in the final season; the finale addresses what remains after. The ending acknowledges that the system perpetuates itself—new monsters replace old ones. It's not a happy ending, but it's the only honest one.
