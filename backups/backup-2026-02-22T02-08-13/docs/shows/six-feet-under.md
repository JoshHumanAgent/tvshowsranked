## What It Feels Like to Watch

Every episode opens with death—a stranger's death that somehow illuminates the Fishers' own struggles with life, love, and mortality. A funeral home in Los Angeles becomes the setting for one of television's most profound explorations of what it means to live while constantly surrounded by death.

Nate Fisher is the prodigal son who returns home to his family's funeral home, only to face his own mortality when a brain aneurysm nearly kills him. His brother David runs the business but struggles with his sexuality and identity. Their sister Claire is the goth teenager who grows into an artist. And Ruth, their mother, never asked for any of this—she's a woman who buried a husband and is now running a funeral home with children who can't get along.

Alan Ball finds poetry in the business of endings. The show is funny—darkly so at times—and deeply moving. It teaches you about death by showing you how different people face it: with denial, with faith, with rage, with acceptance. And it shows that death isn't the opposite of life—it's woven into every moment of it.

The finale—"Six Feet Under and Flames"—is widely considered the greatest series finale ever made. Each character's ending is revealed in a beautiful montage that shows how each of them dies, and the final image of the Fisher family home burning while "I'll Fly Away" plays is unforgettable. It will make you weep. It'll make you understand something true about life.
