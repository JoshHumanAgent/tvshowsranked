## What It Feels Like to Watch

Mr. Robot is what happens when prestige television takes on the hacker genre—and the result is something far more profound than you might expect.

You meet Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek), a cybersecurity engineer by day, a vigilante hacker by night. He has social anxiety, depression, and a habit of speaking directly to the audience—and to himself. He's our guide into a world of corporate espionage, government surveillance, and ideological warfare.

The first episode drops you in without explanation. You don't know who to trust, what's real, or where the story is going. That's by design. Mr. Robot rewards attention and rewatching in ways that reveal hidden layers.

Rami Malek is extraordinary. His Elliot is fragile and brilliant, vulnerable and dangerous. He carries the show on his shoulders, and he makes you believe every contradiction.

The series tackles big themes—corporate corruption, surveillance capitalism, the nature of identity, the cost of idealism—with intelligence and nuance. It's prescient, too: the show aired before many of the real-world events it seems to predict.

The final season delivers a conclusion that divided fans but satisfied many more. It takes risks that most shows wouldn't, and it commits to its vision completely.

### 4. Visual Spectacle (10%) — Score: 6

**Raw Score: 6 | Weighted: 0.60**
