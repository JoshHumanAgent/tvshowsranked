Brian Cox delivers a towering performance as Logan Roy, the aging media mogul whose four children fight for his approval and his empire. Creator Jesse Armstrong balances dark comedy with genuine emotional weight, creating a show that exposes the hollowness of power while being utterly addictive viewing.",
