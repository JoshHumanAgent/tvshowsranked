    "consensus_highlights":  "Adolescence is a groundbreaking British drama that examines the arrest of a 13-year-old boy for murder, told in real-time across four episodes. The series explores online radicalization, toxic masculinity, and the failures of institutions to protect children. Its innovative single-take filming and powerful performances create an unflinching portrait of modern youth.",
